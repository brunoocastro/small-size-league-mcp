Simulation Setup for virtual Small Size League Tournament
This repository contains the configuration for a virtual Small Size League tournament
with multiple fields and all components that are required.
Setup idea
A single powerful root server is used per field
Teams only access the server via Browser with Guacamole
A team has access to its own VNC session (a virtual desktop)
All teams have view access to all VNC sessions, to make sure nobody is touching their system during a match
A team may submit a custom docker image with additional dependencies
The home folder is backed by a docker volume. Teams can check out their code here, and it will survive container restarts and rebuilds
The field can be viewed with the ssl-vision-client in the browser
The ssl-status-board shows the game state in the browser
The ssl-game-controller is protected with user/password. Only the refereeing team and the admin is activated per match.
The 
ssl-simulation-controller
 manages manual ball and robot placement and simulation configuration
Requirements
Following software is required, which should be available on all major operating systems:
Docker and Docker-Compose
Bash
Python 3
Preparations for teams
As a team, you need to make sure that your software can run on Ubuntu 20.04 and without root permissions.
If you require a GPU or have other specific requirements, ask the technical committee if it will be possible.
Each team has its own docker container including a simple desktop environment.
If you need additional libraries to run and/or build your software, create a custom docker image based on 
src/ubuntu-vnc
. Use 
src/ubuntu-vnc-java
 as a template. Then submit a pull-request with the new docker image.
It is possible to copy files into the container, so you can also build your software locally and only copy the binaries over.
Your container will have a volume mounted to the home folder. The volume will be used for all fields, while there will be individual containers per field. You do not need to worry about changing any network addresses or ports, they will always be the same.
You should be able to handle multiple network interfaces, though.
To integrate your own container, add a new service to 
docker-compose-teams.yaml
. Take the tigers or erforce service as a template.
Also, add your team name to 
config/teams
. It should be all-lower-case without any special characters.
Setup
If you want to use a remote server, change the root domain and field name first in 
./config/root_domain
 and 
./config/field_name
. Else, the defaults are fine.
Before you start anything, you need to initialize some secrets with:
./config/docker/init.sh
This will generate passwords and an SSH key and put them at the right places.
Next, generate the initial Caddyfile for the webserver:
#
 You may need/want to have a virtual environment to make python dependencies available (or install it globally)
python3 -m venv .venv
source
 .venv/bin/activate
pip install jinja2 requests
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
Now, you can spin up the field:
#
 Start all containers and keep showing the log in the foreground (ctrl+c will stop everything again)
docker compose up
#
 Or alternatively run all containers in the background:
docker compose up -d
Next, setup Guacamole and caddy:
#
 Sets up the running Guacamole (VNC) server. Will also generate team passwords.
./config/guacamole/update_guacamole.py
#
 Convert all passwords into a caddy format for the game-controller
./config/caddy/update_caddy_passwords.sh
#
 Regenerate the Caddyfile with the newly created passwords
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
#
 Reload the running caddy webserver
./config/caddy/update_caddy_config.sh
Finally, spin up the team containers that you need:
#
 Start team containers (individually or all together)
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up [team-container]
If you want to have additional monitoring, you can also start the monitoring containers:
#
 Start monitoring containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-monitoring.yaml up
Access
You can access the field through your browser now.
The URL is 
https://localhost
 or whatever you chose as the root domain.
If you are running locally, you might want to add the local CA from caddy to your system with:
#
 Note: Have a look at this script for more details
./caddy/install_local_CA.sh
All credentials were generated to 
./config/passwords
.
Usage notes
In Guacamole, you can press Ctrl + Shift + Alt to open a menu where you can copy files from/to the VNC session.
You can also drag&drop files into the browser tab to copy files into the home folder
The home folder is backed by a volume, so all files in the home folder will survive container rebuilds
To paste text into the terminal, use Shift+Insert
Shutdown and cleanup
Stop and remove all containers, networks and volumes (
-v
) for a specific field:
docker compose down -v
Run on AWS
The full setup can be deployed to AWS with terraform:
cd
 terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
Make sure to make yourself familiar with AWS and terraform, before doing this. Most notably:
You have to install AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials
You have to add your public key to 
./terraform/scripts/bootstrap.yaml
 to be able to SSH into the instances
You have to configure a domain and point it to the public IP that is returned by terraform
You have to set the required TF variables
You can connect to the instances with:
ssh terraform@
<
public-ip
>
#
 Check the cloud-init log
less /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
#
 Go to setup folder
cd
 ssl-simulation-setup
#
 Start team containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up -d [team-container]
To destroy the setup, run:
terraform destroy
Update
The database setup scripts are pre-generated already, but if
the guacamole version changes, the script might need to be generated again with:
docker run --rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --postgresql 
>
 init/postgres/01_initdb.sql

Simulation Setup for virtual Small Size League Tournament
This repository contains the configuration for a virtual Small Size League tournament
with multiple fields and all components that are required.
Setup idea
A single powerful root server is used per field
Teams only access the server via Browser with Guacamole
A team has access to its own VNC session (a virtual desktop)
All teams have view access to all VNC sessions, to make sure nobody is touching their system during a match
A team may submit a custom docker image with additional dependencies
The home folder is backed by a docker volume. Teams can check out their code here, and it will survive container restarts and rebuilds
The field can be viewed with the ssl-vision-client in the browser
The ssl-status-board shows the game state in the browser
The ssl-game-controller is protected with user/password. Only the refereeing team and the admin is activated per match.
The 
ssl-simulation-controller
 manages manual ball and robot placement and simulation configuration
Requirements
Following software is required, which should be available on all major operating systems:
Docker and Docker-Compose
Bash
Python 3
Preparations for teams
As a team, you need to make sure that your software can run on Ubuntu 20.04 and without root permissions.
If you require a GPU or have other specific requirements, ask the technical committee if it will be possible.
Each team has its own docker container including a simple desktop environment.
If you need additional libraries to run and/or build your software, create a custom docker image based on 
src/ubuntu-vnc
. Use 
src/ubuntu-vnc-java
 as a template. Then submit a pull-request with the new docker image.
It is possible to copy files into the container, so you can also build your software locally and only copy the binaries over.
Your container will have a volume mounted to the home folder. The volume will be used for all fields, while there will be individual containers per field. You do not need to worry about changing any network addresses or ports, they will always be the same.
You should be able to handle multiple network interfaces, though.
To integrate your own container, add a new service to 
docker-compose-teams.yaml
. Take the tigers or erforce service as a template.
Also, add your team name to 
config/teams
. It should be all-lower-case without any special characters.
Setup
If you want to use a remote server, change the root domain and field name first in 
./config/root_domain
 and 
./config/field_name
. Else, the defaults are fine.
Before you start anything, you need to initialize some secrets with:
./config/docker/init.sh
This will generate passwords and an SSH key and put them at the right places.
Next, generate the initial Caddyfile for the webserver:
#
 You may need/want to have a virtual environment to make python dependencies available (or install it globally)
python3 -m venv .venv
source
 .venv/bin/activate
pip install jinja2 requests
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
Now, you can spin up the field:
#
 Start all containers and keep showing the log in the foreground (ctrl+c will stop everything again)
docker compose build
docker compose up
#
 Or alternatively run all containers in the background:
docker compose up -d
Next, setup Guacamole and caddy:
#
 Sets up the running Guacamole (VNC) server. Will also generate team passwords.
./config/guacamole/update_guacamole.py
#
 Convert all passwords into a caddy format for the game-controller
./config/caddy/update_caddy_passwords.sh
#
 Regenerate the Caddyfile with the newly created passwords
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
#
 Reload the running caddy webserver
./config/caddy/update_caddy_config.sh
Finally, spin up the team containers that you need:
#
 Start team containers (individually or all together)
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up [team-container]
If you want to have additional monitoring, you can also start the monitoring containers:
#
 Start monitoring containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-monitoring.yaml up
Access
You can access the field through your browser now.
The URL is 
https://localhost
 or whatever you chose as the root domain.
If you are running locally, you might want to add the local CA from caddy to your system with:
#
 Note: Have a look at this script for more details
./caddy/install_local_CA.sh
All credentials were generated to 
./config/passwords
.
Usage notes
In Guacamole, you can press Ctrl + Shift + Alt to open a menu where you can copy files from/to the VNC session.
You can also drag&drop files into the browser tab to copy files into the home folder
The home folder is backed by a volume, so all files in the home folder will survive container rebuilds
To paste text into the terminal, use Shift+Insert
Shutdown and cleanup
Stop and remove all containers, networks and volumes (
-v
) for a specific field:
docker compose down -v
Run on AWS
The full setup can be deployed to AWS with terraform:
cd
 terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
Make sure to make yourself familiar with AWS and terraform, before doing this. Most notably:
You have to install AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials
You have to add your public key to 
./terraform/scripts/bootstrap.yaml
 to be able to SSH into the instances
You have to configure a domain and point it to the public IP that is returned by terraform
You have to set the required TF variables
You can connect to the instances with:
ssh terraform@
<
public-ip
>
#
 Check the cloud-init log
less /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
#
 Go to setup folder
cd
 ssl-simulation-setup
#
 Start team containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up -d [team-container]
To destroy the setup, run:
terraform destroy
Update
The database setup scripts are pre-generated already, but if
the guacamole version changes, the script might need to be generated again with:
docker run --rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --postgresql 
>
 init/postgres/01_initdb.sql

Simulation Setup for virtual Small Size League Tournament
This repository contains the configuration for a virtual Small Size League tournament
with multiple fields and all components that are required.
Setup idea
A single powerful root server is used per field
Teams only access the server via Browser with Guacamole
A team has access to its own VNC session (a virtual desktop)
All teams have view access to all VNC sessions, to make sure nobody is touching their system during a match
A team may submit a custom docker image with additional dependencies
The home folder is backed by a docker volume. Teams can check out their code here, and it will survive container restarts and rebuilds
The field can be viewed with the ssl-vision-client in the browser
The ssl-status-board shows the game state in the browser
The ssl-game-controller is protected with user/password. Only the refereeing team and the admin is activated per match.
The 
ssl-simulation-controller
 manages manual ball and robot placement and simulation configuration
Requirements
Following software is required, which should be available on all major operating systems:
Docker and Docker-Compose
Bash
Python 3
Preparations for teams
As a team, you need to make sure that your software can run on Ubuntu 20.04 and without root permissions.
If you require a GPU or have other specific requirements, ask the technical committee if it will be possible.
Each team has its own docker container including a simple desktop environment.
If you need additional libraries to run and/or build your software, create a custom docker image based on 
src/ubuntu-vnc
. Use 
src/ubuntu-vnc-java
 as a template. Then submit a pull-request with the new docker image.
It is possible to copy files into the container, so you can also build your software locally and only copy the binaries over.
Your container will have a volume mounted to the home folder. The volume will be used for all fields, while there will be individual containers per field. You do not need to worry about changing any network addresses or ports, they will always be the same.
You should be able to handle multiple network interfaces, though.
To integrate your own container, add a new service to 
docker-compose-teams.yaml
. Take the tigers or erforce service as a template.
Also, add your team name to 
config/teams
. It should be all-lower-case without any special characters.
Setup
If you want to use a remote server, change the root domain and field name first in 
./config/root_domain
 and 
./config/field_name
. Else, the defaults are fine.
Before you start anything, you need to initialize some secrets with:
./config/docker/init.sh
This will generate passwords and an SSH key and put them at the right places.
Next, generate the initial Caddyfile for the webserver:
#
 You may need/want to have a virtual environment to make python dependencies available (or install it globally)
python3 -m venv .venv
source
 .venv/bin/activate
pip install jinja2 requests
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
Now, you can spin up the field:
#
 Start all containers and keep showing the log in the foreground (ctrl+c will stop everything again)
docker compose up
#
 Or alternatively run all containers in the background:
docker compose up -d
Next, setup Guacamole and caddy:
#
 Sets up the running Guacamole (VNC) server. Will also generate team passwords.
./config/guacamole/update_guacamole.py
#
 Convert all passwords into a caddy format for the game-controller
./config/caddy/update_caddy_passwords.sh
#
 Regenerate the Caddyfile with the newly created passwords
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
#
 Reload the running caddy webserver
./config/caddy/update_caddy_config.sh
Finally, spin up the team containers that you need:
#
 Start team containers (individually or all together)
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up [team-container]
If you want to have additional monitoring, you can also start the monitoring containers:
#
 Start monitoring containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-monitoring.yaml up
Access
You can access the field through your browser now.
The URL is 
https://localhost
 or whatever you chose as the root domain.
If you are running locally, you might want to add the local CA from caddy to your system with:
#
 Note: Have a look at this script for more details
./caddy/install_local_CA.sh
All credentials were generated to 
./config/passwords
.
Usage notes
In Guacamole, you can press Ctrl + Shift + Alt to open a menu where you can copy files from/to the VNC session.
You can also drag&drop files into the browser tab to copy files into the home folder
The home folder is backed by a volume, so all files in the home folder will survive container rebuilds
To paste text into the terminal, use Shift+Insert
Shutdown and cleanup
Stop and remove all containers, networks and volumes (
-v
) for a specific field:
docker compose down -v
Run on AWS
The full setup can be deployed to AWS with terraform:
cd
 terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
Make sure to make yourself familiar with AWS and terraform, before doing this. Most notably:
You have to install AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials
You have to add your public key to 
./terraform/scripts/bootstrap.yaml
 to be able to SSH into the instances
You have to configure a domain and point it to the public IP that is returned by terraform
You have to set the required TF variables
You can connect to the instances with:
ssh terraform@
<
public-ip
>
#
 Check the cloud-init log
less /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
#
 Go to setup folder
cd
 ssl-simulation-setup
#
 Start team containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up -d [team-container]
To destroy the setup, run:
terraform destroy
Update
The database setup scripts are pre-generated already, but if
the guacamole version changes, the script might need to be generated again with:
docker run --rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --postgresql 
>
 init/postgres/01_initdb.sql

Simulation Setup for virtual Small Size League Tournament
This repository contains the configuration for a virtual Small Size League tournament
with multiple fields and all components that are required.
Setup idea
A single powerful root server is used per field
Teams only access the server via Browser with Guacamole
A team has access to its own VNC session (a virtual desktop)
All teams have view access to all VNC sessions, to make sure nobody is touching their system during a match
A team may submit a custom docker image with additional dependencies
The home folder is backed by a docker volume. Teams can check out their code here, and it will survive container restarts and rebuilds
The field can be viewed with the ssl-vision-client in the browser
The ssl-status-board shows the game state in the browser
The ssl-game-controller is protected with user/password. Only the refereeing team and the admin is activated per match.
The 
ssl-simulation-controller
 manages manual ball and robot placement and simulation configuration
Requirements
Following software is required, which should be available on all major operating systems:
Docker and Docker-Compose
Bash
Python 3
Preparations for teams
As a team, you need to make sure that your software can run on Ubuntu 20.04 and without root permissions.
If you require a GPU or have other specific requirements, ask the technical committee if it will be possible.
Each team has its own docker container including a simple desktop environment.
If you need additional libraries to run and/or build your software, create a custom docker image based on 
src/ubuntu-vnc
. Use 
src/ubuntu-vnc-java
 as a template. Then submit a pull-request with the new docker image.
It is possible to copy files into the container, so you can also build your software locally and only copy the binaries over.
Your container will have a volume mounted to the home folder. The volume will be used for all fields, while there will be individual containers per field. You do not need to worry about changing any network addresses or ports, they will always be the same.
You should be able to handle multiple network interfaces, though.
To integrate your own container, add a new service to 
docker-compose-teams.yaml
. Take the tigers or erforce service as a template.
Also, add your team name to 
config/teams
. It should be all-lower-case without any special characters.
Setup
If you want to use a remote server, change the root domain and field name first in 
./config/root_domain
 and 
./config/field_name
. Else, the defaults are fine.
Before you start anything, you need to initialize some secrets with:
./config/docker/init.sh
This will generate passwords and an SSH key and put them at the right places.
Next, generate the initial Caddyfile for the webserver:
#
 You may need/want to have a virtual environment to make python dependencies available (or install it globally)
python3 -m venv .venv
source
 .venv/bin/activate
pip install jinja2 requests
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
Now, you can spin up the field:
#
 Start all containers and keep showing the log in the foreground (ctrl+c will stop everything again)
docker compose up
#
 Or alternatively run all containers in the background:
docker compose up -d
Next, setup Guacamole and caddy:
#
 Sets up the running Guacamole (VNC) server. Will also generate team passwords.
./config/guacamole/update_guacamole.py
#
 Convert all passwords into a caddy format for the game-controller
./config/caddy/update_caddy_passwords.sh
#
 Regenerate the Caddyfile with the newly created passwords
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
#
 Reload the running caddy webserver
./config/caddy/update_caddy_config.sh
Finally, spin up the team containers that you need:
#
 Start team containers (individually or all together)
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up [team-container]
If you want to have additional monitoring, you can also start the monitoring containers:
#
 Start monitoring containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-monitoring.yaml up
Access
You can access the field through your browser now.
The URL is 
https://localhost
 or whatever you chose as the root domain.
If you are running locally, you might want to add the local CA from caddy to your system with:
#
 Note: Have a look at this script for more details
./caddy/install_local_CA.sh
All credentials were generated to 
./config/passwords
.
Usage notes
In Guacamole, you can press Ctrl + Shift + Alt to open a menu where you can copy files from/to the VNC session.
You can also drag&drop files into the browser tab to copy files into the home folder
The home folder is backed by a volume, so all files in the home folder will survive container rebuilds
To paste text into the terminal, use Shift+Insert
Shutdown and cleanup
Stop and remove all containers, networks and volumes (
-v
) for a specific field:
docker compose down -v
Run on AWS
The full setup can be deployed to AWS with terraform:
cd
 terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
Make sure to make yourself familiar with AWS and terraform, before doing this. Most notably:
You have to install AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials
You have to add your public key to 
./terraform/scripts/bootstrap.yaml
 to be able to SSH into the instances
You have to configure a domain and point it to the public IP that is returned by terraform
You have to set the required TF variables
You can connect to the instances with:
ssh terraform@
<
public-ip
>
#
 Check the cloud-init log
less /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
#
 Go to setup folder
cd
 ssl-simulation-setup
#
 Start team containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up -d [team-container]
To destroy the setup, run:
terraform destroy
Update
The database setup scripts are pre-generated already, but if
the guacamole version changes, the script might need to be generated again with:
docker run --rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --postgresql 
>
 init/postgres/01_initdb.sql

You can also drag&drop files into the browser tab to copy files into the home folder
The home folder is backed by a volume, so all files in the home folder will survive container rebuilds
To paste text into the terminal, use Shift+Insert
Shutdown and cleanup
Stop and remove all containers, networks and volumes (
-v
) for a specific field:
docker compose down -v
Run on AWS
The full setup can be deployed to AWS with terraform:
cd
 terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
Make sure to make yourself familiar with AWS and terraform, before doing this. Most notably:
You have to install AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials
You have to add your public key to 
./terraform/scripts/bootstrap.yaml
 to be able to SSH into the instances
You have to configure a domain and point it to the public IP that is returned by terraform
You have to set the required TF variables
You can connect to the instances with:
ssh terraform@
<
public-ip
>
#
 Check the cloud-init log
less /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
#
 Go to setup folder
cd
 ssl-simulation-setup
#
 Start team containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up -d [team-container]
To destroy the setup, run:
terraform destroy
Update
The database setup scripts are pre-generated already, but if
the guacamole version changes, the script might need to be generated again with:
docker run --rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --postgresql 
>
 init/postgres/01_initdb.sql

Simulation Setup for virtual Small Size League Tournament
This repository contains the configuration for a virtual Small Size League tournament
with multiple fields and all components that are required.
Setup idea
A single powerful root server is used per field
Teams only access the server via Browser with Guacamole
A team has access to its own VNC session (a virtual desktop)
All teams have view access to all VNC sessions, to make sure nobody is touching their system during a match
A team may submit a custom docker image with additional dependencies
The home folder is backed by a docker volume. Teams can check out their code here, and it will survive container restarts and rebuilds
The field can be viewed with the ssl-vision-client in the browser
The ssl-status-board shows the game state in the browser
The ssl-game-controller is protected with user/password. Only the refereeing team and the admin is activated per match.
The 
ssl-simulation-controller
 manages manual ball and robot placement and simulation configuration
Requirements
Following software is required, which should be available on all major operating systems:
Docker and Docker-Compose
Bash
Python 3
Preparations for teams
As a team, you need to make sure that your software can run on Ubuntu 20.04 and without root permissions.
If you require a GPU or have other specific requirements, ask the technical committee if it will be possible.
Each team has its own docker container including a simple desktop environment.
If you need additional libraries to run and/or build your software, create a custom docker image based on 
src/ubuntu-vnc
. Use 
src/ubuntu-vnc-java
 as a template. Then submit a pull-request with the new docker image.
It is possible to copy files into the container, so you can also build your software locally and only copy the binaries over.
Your container will have a volume mounted to the home folder. The volume will be used for all fields, while there will be individual containers per field. You do not need to worry about changing any network addresses or ports, they will always be the same.
You should be able to handle multiple network interfaces, though.
To integrate your own container, add a new service to 
docker-compose-teams.yaml
. Take the tigers or erforce service as a template.
Also, add your team name to 
config/teams
. It should be all-lower-case without any special characters.
Setup
If you want to use a remote server, change the root domain and field name first in 
./config/root_domain
 and 
./config/field_name
. Else, the defaults are fine.
Before you start anything, you need to initialize some secrets with:
./config/docker/init.sh
This will generate passwords and an SSH key and put them at the right places.
Next, generate the initial Caddyfile for the webserver:
#
 You may need/want to have a virtual environment to make python dependencies available (or install it globally)
python3 -m venv .venv
source
 .venv/bin/activate
pip install jinja2 requests
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
Now, you can spin up the field:
#
 Start all containers and keep showing the log in the foreground (ctrl+c will stop everything again)
docker compose up
#
 Or alternatively run all containers in the background:
docker compose up -d
Next, setup Guacamole and caddy:
#
 Sets up the running Guacamole (VNC) server. Will also generate team passwords.
./config/guacamole/update_guacamole.py
#
 Convert all passwords into a caddy format for the game-controller
./config/caddy/update_caddy_passwords.sh
#
 Regenerate the Caddyfile with the newly created passwords
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
#
 Reload the running caddy webserver
./config/caddy/update_caddy_config.sh
Finally, spin up the team containers that you need:
#
 Start team containers (individually or all together)
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up [team-container]
If you want to have additional monitoring, you can also start the monitoring containers:
#
 Start monitoring containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-monitoring.yaml up
Access
You can access the field through your browser now.
The URL is 
https://localhost
 or whatever you chose as the root domain.
If you are running locally, you might want to add the local CA from caddy to your system with:
#
 Note: Have a look at this script for more details
./caddy/install_local_CA.sh
All credentials were generated to 
./config/passwords
.
Usage notes
In Guacamole, you can press Ctrl + Shift + Alt to open a menu where you can copy files from/to the VNC session.
You can also drag&drop files into the browser tab to copy files into the home folder
The home folder is backed by a volume, so all files in the home folder will survive container rebuilds

As a team, you need to make sure that your software can run on Ubuntu 20.04 and without root permissions.
If you require a GPU or have other specific requirements, ask the technical committee if it will be possible.
Each team has its own docker container including a simple desktop environment.
If you need additional libraries to run and/or build your software, create a custom docker image based on 
src/ubuntu-vnc
. Use 
src/ubuntu-vnc-java
 as a template. Then submit a pull-request with the new docker image.
It is possible to copy files into the container, so you can also build your software locally and only copy the binaries over.
Your container will have a volume mounted to the home folder. The volume will be used for all fields, while there will be individual containers per field. You do not need to worry about changing any network addresses or ports, they will always be the same.
You should be able to handle multiple network interfaces, though.
To integrate your own container, add a new service to 
docker-compose-teams.yaml
. Take the tigers or erforce service as a template.
Also, add your team name to 
config/teams
. It should be all-lower-case without any special characters.
Setup
If you want to use a remote server, change the root domain and field name first in 
./config/root_domain
 and 
./config/field_name
. Else, the defaults are fine.
Before you start anything, you need to initialize some secrets with:
./config/docker/init.sh
This will generate passwords and an SSH key and put them at the right places.
Next, generate the initial Caddyfile for the webserver:
#
 You may need/want to have a virtual environment to make python dependencies available (or install it globally)
python3 -m venv .venv
source
 .venv/bin/activate
pip install jinja2 requests
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
Now, you can spin up the field:
#
 Start all containers and keep showing the log in the foreground (ctrl+c will stop everything again)
docker compose up
#
 Or alternatively run all containers in the background:
docker compose up -d
Next, setup Guacamole and caddy:
#
 Sets up the running Guacamole (VNC) server. Will also generate team passwords.
./config/guacamole/update_guacamole.py
#
 Convert all passwords into a caddy format for the game-controller
./config/caddy/update_caddy_passwords.sh
#
 Regenerate the Caddyfile with the newly created passwords
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
#
 Reload the running caddy webserver
./config/caddy/update_caddy_config.sh
Finally, spin up the team containers that you need:
#
 Start team containers (individually or all together)
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up [team-container]
If you want to have additional monitoring, you can also start the monitoring containers:
#
 Start monitoring containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-monitoring.yaml up
Access
You can access the field through your browser now.
The URL is 
https://localhost
 or whatever you chose as the root domain.
If you are running locally, you might want to add the local CA from caddy to your system with:
#
 Note: Have a look at this script for more details
./caddy/install_local_CA.sh
All credentials were generated to 
./config/passwords
.
Usage notes
In Guacamole, you can press Ctrl + Shift + Alt to open a menu where you can copy files from/to the VNC session.
You can also drag&drop files into the browser tab to copy files into the home folder
The home folder is backed by a volume, so all files in the home folder will survive container rebuilds
To paste text into the terminal, use Shift+Insert
Shutdown and cleanup
Stop and remove all containers, networks and volumes (
-v
) for a specific field:
docker compose down -v
Run on AWS
The full setup can be deployed to AWS with terraform:
cd
 terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
Make sure to make yourself familiar with AWS and terraform, before doing this. Most notably:
You have to install AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials
You have to add your public key to 
./terraform/scripts/bootstrap.yaml
 to be able to SSH into the instances
You have to configure a domain and point it to the public IP that is returned by terraform
You have to set the required TF variables
You can connect to the instances with:
ssh terraform@
<
public-ip
>
#
 Check the cloud-init log
less /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
#
 Go to setup folder
cd
 ssl-simulation-setup
#
 Start team containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up -d [team-container]
To destroy the setup, run:
terraform destroy
Update
The database setup scripts are pre-generated already, but if
the guacamole version changes, the script might need to be generated again with:
docker run --rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --postgresql 
>
 init/postgres/01_initdb.sql

Simulation Setup for virtual Small Size League Tournament
This repository contains the configuration for a virtual Small Size League tournament
with multiple fields and all components that are required.
Setup idea
A single powerful root server is used per field
Teams only access the server via Browser with Guacamole
A team has access to its own VNC session (a virtual desktop)
All teams have view access to all VNC sessions, to make sure nobody is touching their system during a match
A team may submit a custom docker image with additional dependencies
The home folder is backed by a docker volume. Teams can check out their code here, and it will survive container restarts and rebuilds
The field can be viewed with the ssl-vision-client in the browser
The ssl-status-board shows the game state in the browser
The ssl-game-controller is protected with user/password. Only the refereeing team and the admin is activated per match.
The 
ssl-simulation-controller
 manages manual ball and robot placement and simulation configuration
Requirements
Following software is required, which should be available on all major operating systems:
Docker and Docker-Compose
Bash
Python 3

Simulation Setup for virtual Small Size League Tournament
This repository contains the configuration for a virtual Small Size League tournament
with multiple fields and all components that are required.
Setup idea
A single powerful root server is used per field
Teams only access the server via Browser with Guacamole
A team has access to its own VNC session (a virtual desktop)
All teams have view access to all VNC sessions, to make sure nobody is touching their system during a match
A team may submit a custom docker image with additional dependencies
The home folder is backed by a docker volume. Teams can check out their code here, and it will survive container restarts and rebuilds
The field can be viewed with the ssl-vision-client in the browser
The ssl-status-board shows the game state in the browser
The ssl-game-controller is protected with user/password. Only the refereeing team and the admin is activated per match.
The 
ssl-simulation-controller
 manages manual ball and robot placement and simulation configuration
Requirements
Following software is required, which should be available on all major operating systems:
Docker and Docker-Compose
Bash
Python 3
Preparations for teams
As a team, you need to make sure that your software can run on Ubuntu 20.04 and without root permissions.
If you require a GPU or have other specific requirements, ask the technical committee if it will be possible.
Each team has its own docker container including a simple desktop environment.
If you need additional libraries to run and/or build your software, create a custom docker image based on 
src/ubuntu-vnc
. Use 
src/ubuntu-vnc-java
 as a template. Then submit a pull-request with the new docker image.
It is possible to copy files into the container, so you can also build your software locally and only copy the binaries over.
Your container will have a volume mounted to the home folder. The volume will be used for all fields, while there will be individual containers per field. You do not need to worry about changing any network addresses or ports, they will always be the same.
You should be able to handle multiple network interfaces, though.
To integrate your own container, add a new service to 
docker-compose-teams.yaml
. Take the tigers or erforce service as a template.
Also, add your team name to 
config/teams
. It should be all-lower-case without any special characters.
Setup
If you want to use a remote server, change the root domain and field name first in 
./config/root_domain
 and 
./config/field_name
. Else, the defaults are fine.
Before you start anything, you need to initialize some secrets with:
./config/docker/init.sh
This will generate passwords and an SSH key and put them at the right places.
Next, generate the initial Caddyfile for the webserver:
#
 You may need/want to have a virtual environment to make python dependencies available (or install it globally)
python3 -m venv .venv
source
 .venv/bin/activate
pip install jinja2 requests
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
Now, you can spin up the field:
#
 Start all containers and keep showing the log in the foreground (ctrl+c will stop everything again)
docker compose up
#
 Or alternatively run all containers in the background:
docker compose up -d
Next, setup Guacamole and caddy:
#
 Sets up the running Guacamole (VNC) server. Will also generate team passwords.
./config/guacamole/update_guacamole.py
#
 Convert all passwords into a caddy format for the game-controller
./config/caddy/update_caddy_passwords.sh
#
 Regenerate the Caddyfile with the newly created passwords
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
#
 Reload the running caddy webserver
./config/caddy/update_caddy_config.sh
Finally, spin up the team containers that you need:
#
 Start team containers (individually or all together)
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up [team-container]
If you want to have additional monitoring, you can also start the monitoring containers:
#
 Start monitoring containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-monitoring.yaml up
Access
You can access the field through your browser now.
The URL is 
https://localhost
 or whatever you chose as the root domain.
If you are running locally, you might want to add the local CA from caddy to your system with:
#
 Note: Have a look at this script for more details
./caddy/install_local_CA.sh
All credentials were generated to 
./config/passwords
.
Usage notes
In Guacamole, you can press Ctrl + Shift + Alt to open a menu where you can copy files from/to the VNC session.
You can also drag&drop files into the browser tab to copy files into the home folder
The home folder is backed by a volume, so all files in the home folder will survive container rebuilds
To paste text into the terminal, use Shift+Insert
Shutdown and cleanup
Stop and remove all containers, networks and volumes (
-v
) for a specific field:
docker compose down -v
Run on AWS
The full setup can be deployed to AWS with terraform:
cd
 terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
Make sure to make yourself familiar with AWS and terraform, before doing this. Most notably:
You have to install AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials
You have to add your public key to 
./terraform/scripts/bootstrap.yaml
 to be able to SSH into the instances
You have to configure a domain and point it to the public IP that is returned by terraform
You have to set the required TF variables
You can connect to the instances with:
ssh terraform@
<
public-ip
>
#
 Check the cloud-init log
less /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
#
 Go to setup folder
cd
 ssl-simulation-setup
#
 Start team containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up -d [team-container]
To destroy the setup, run:
terraform destroy
Update
The database setup scripts are pre-generated already, but if
the guacamole version changes, the script might need to be generated again with:
docker run --rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --postgresql 
>
 init/postgres/01_initdb.sql

All teams have view access to all VNC sessions, to make sure nobody is touching their system during a match
A team may submit a custom docker image with additional dependencies
The home folder is backed by a docker volume. Teams can check out their code here, and it will survive container restarts and rebuilds
The field can be viewed with the ssl-vision-client in the browser
The ssl-status-board shows the game state in the browser
The ssl-game-controller is protected with user/password. Only the refereeing team and the admin is activated per match.
The 
ssl-simulation-controller
 manages manual ball and robot placement and simulation configuration
Requirements
Following software is required, which should be available on all major operating systems:
Docker and Docker-Compose
Bash
Python 3
Preparations for teams
As a team, you need to make sure that your software can run on Ubuntu 20.04 and without root permissions.
If you require a GPU or have other specific requirements, ask the technical committee if it will be possible.
Each team has its own docker container including a simple desktop environment.
If you need additional libraries to run and/or build your software, create a custom docker image based on 
src/ubuntu-vnc
. Use 
src/ubuntu-vnc-java
 as a template. Then submit a pull-request with the new docker image.
It is possible to copy files into the container, so you can also build your software locally and only copy the binaries over.
Your container will have a volume mounted to the home folder. The volume will be used for all fields, while there will be individual containers per field. You do not need to worry about changing any network addresses or ports, they will always be the same.
You should be able to handle multiple network interfaces, though.
To integrate your own container, add a new service to 
docker-compose-teams.yaml
. Take the tigers or erforce service as a template.
Also, add your team name to 
config/teams
. It should be all-lower-case without any special characters.
Setup
If you want to use a remote server, change the root domain and field name first in 
./config/root_domain
 and 
./config/field_name
. Else, the defaults are fine.
Before you start anything, you need to initialize some secrets with:
./config/docker/init.sh
This will generate passwords and an SSH key and put them at the right places.
Next, generate the initial Caddyfile for the webserver:
#
 You may need/want to have a virtual environment to make python dependencies available (or install it globally)
python3 -m venv .venv
source
 .venv/bin/activate
pip install jinja2 requests
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
Now, you can spin up the field:
#
 Start all containers and keep showing the log in the foreground (ctrl+c will stop everything again)
docker compose up
#
 Or alternatively run all containers in the background:
docker compose up -d
Next, setup Guacamole and caddy:
#
 Sets up the running Guacamole (VNC) server. Will also generate team passwords.
./config/guacamole/update_guacamole.py
#
 Convert all passwords into a caddy format for the game-controller
./config/caddy/update_caddy_passwords.sh
#
 Regenerate the Caddyfile with the newly created passwords
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
#
 Reload the running caddy webserver
./config/caddy/update_caddy_config.sh
Finally, spin up the team containers that you need:
#
 Start team containers (individually or all together)
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up [team-container]
If you want to have additional monitoring, you can also start the monitoring containers:
#
 Start monitoring containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-monitoring.yaml up
Access
You can access the field through your browser now.
The URL is 
https://localhost
 or whatever you chose as the root domain.
If you are running locally, you might want to add the local CA from caddy to your system with:
#
 Note: Have a look at this script for more details
./caddy/install_local_CA.sh
All credentials were generated to 
./config/passwords
.
Usage notes
In Guacamole, you can press Ctrl + Shift + Alt to open a menu where you can copy files from/to the VNC session.
You can also drag&drop files into the browser tab to copy files into the home folder
The home folder is backed by a volume, so all files in the home folder will survive container rebuilds
To paste text into the terminal, use Shift+Insert
Shutdown and cleanup
Stop and remove all containers, networks and volumes (
-v
) for a specific field:
docker compose down -v
Run on AWS
The full setup can be deployed to AWS with terraform:
cd
 terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
Make sure to make yourself familiar with AWS and terraform, before doing this. Most notably:
You have to install AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials
You have to add your public key to 
./terraform/scripts/bootstrap.yaml
 to be able to SSH into the instances
You have to configure a domain and point it to the public IP that is returned by terraform
You have to set the required TF variables
You can connect to the instances with:
ssh terraform@
<
public-ip
>
#
 Check the cloud-init log
less /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
#
 Go to setup folder
cd
 ssl-simulation-setup
#
 Start team containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up -d [team-container]
To destroy the setup, run:
terraform destroy
Update
The database setup scripts are pre-generated already, but if
the guacamole version changes, the script might need to be generated again with:
docker run --rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --postgresql 
>
 init/postgres/01_initdb.sql

A team has access to its own VNC session (a virtual desktop)
All teams have view access to all VNC sessions, to make sure nobody is touching their system during a match
A team may submit a custom docker image with additional dependencies
The home folder is backed by a docker volume. Teams can check out their code here, and it will survive container restarts and rebuilds
The field can be viewed with the ssl-vision-client in the browser
The ssl-status-board shows the game state in the browser
The ssl-game-controller is protected with user/password. Only the refereeing team and the admin is activated per match.
The 
ssl-simulation-controller
 manages manual ball and robot placement and simulation configuration
Requirements
Following software is required, which should be available on all major operating systems:
Docker and Docker-Compose
Bash
Python 3
Preparations for teams
As a team, you need to make sure that your software can run on Ubuntu 20.04 and without root permissions.
If you require a GPU or have other specific requirements, ask the technical committee if it will be possible.
Each team has its own docker container including a simple desktop environment.
If you need additional libraries to run and/or build your software, create a custom docker image based on 
src/ubuntu-vnc
. Use 
src/ubuntu-vnc-java
 as a template. Then submit a pull-request with the new docker image.
It is possible to copy files into the container, so you can also build your software locally and only copy the binaries over.
Your container will have a volume mounted to the home folder. The volume will be used for all fields, while there will be individual containers per field. You do not need to worry about changing any network addresses or ports, they will always be the same.
You should be able to handle multiple network interfaces, though.
To integrate your own container, add a new service to 
docker-compose-teams.yaml
. Take the tigers or erforce service as a template.
Also, add your team name to 
config/teams
. It should be all-lower-case without any special characters.
Setup
If you want to use a remote server, change the root domain and field name first in 
./config/root_domain
 and 
./config/field_name
. Else, the defaults are fine.
Before you start anything, you need to initialize some secrets with:
./config/docker/init.sh
This will generate passwords and an SSH key and put them at the right places.
Next, generate the initial Caddyfile for the webserver:
#
 You may need/want to have a virtual environment to make python dependencies available (or install it globally)
python3 -m venv .venv
source
 .venv/bin/activate
pip install jinja2 requests
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
Now, you can spin up the field:
#
 Start all containers and keep showing the log in the foreground (ctrl+c will stop everything again)
docker compose up
#
 Or alternatively run all containers in the background:
docker compose up -d
Next, setup Guacamole and caddy:
#
 Sets up the running Guacamole (VNC) server. Will also generate team passwords.
./config/guacamole/update_guacamole.py
#
 Convert all passwords into a caddy format for the game-controller
./config/caddy/update_caddy_passwords.sh
#
 Regenerate the Caddyfile with the newly created passwords
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
#
 Reload the running caddy webserver
./config/caddy/update_caddy_config.sh
Finally, spin up the team containers that you need:
#
 Start team containers (individually or all together)
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up [team-container]
If you want to have additional monitoring, you can also start the monitoring containers:
#
 Start monitoring containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-monitoring.yaml up
Access
You can access the field through your browser now.
The URL is 
https://localhost
 or whatever you chose as the root domain.
If you are running locally, you might want to add the local CA from caddy to your system with:
#
 Note: Have a look at this script for more details
./caddy/install_local_CA.sh
All credentials were generated to 
./config/passwords
.
Usage notes
In Guacamole, you can press Ctrl + Shift + Alt to open a menu where you can copy files from/to the VNC session.
You can also drag&drop files into the browser tab to copy files into the home folder
The home folder is backed by a volume, so all files in the home folder will survive container rebuilds
To paste text into the terminal, use Shift+Insert
Shutdown and cleanup
Stop and remove all containers, networks and volumes (
-v
) for a specific field:
docker compose down -v
Run on AWS
The full setup can be deployed to AWS with terraform:
cd
 terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
Make sure to make yourself familiar with AWS and terraform, before doing this. Most notably:
You have to install AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials
You have to add your public key to 
./terraform/scripts/bootstrap.yaml
 to be able to SSH into the instances
You have to configure a domain and point it to the public IP that is returned by terraform
You have to set the required TF variables
You can connect to the instances with:
ssh terraform@
<
public-ip
>
#
 Check the cloud-init log
less /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
#
 Go to setup folder
cd
 ssl-simulation-setup
#
 Start team containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up -d [team-container]
To destroy the setup, run:
terraform destroy
Update
The database setup scripts are pre-generated already, but if
the guacamole version changes, the script might need to be generated again with:
docker run --rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --postgresql 
>
 init/postgres/01_initdb.sql

Teams only access the server via Browser with Guacamole
A team has access to its own VNC session (a virtual desktop)
All teams have view access to all VNC sessions, to make sure nobody is touching their system during a match
A team may submit a custom docker image with additional dependencies
The home folder is backed by a docker volume. Teams can check out their code here, and it will survive container restarts and rebuilds
The field can be viewed with the ssl-vision-client in the browser
The ssl-status-board shows the game state in the browser
The ssl-game-controller is protected with user/password. Only the refereeing team and the admin is activated per match.
The 
ssl-simulation-controller
 manages manual ball and robot placement and simulation configuration
Requirements
Following software is required, which should be available on all major operating systems:
Docker and Docker-Compose
Bash
Python 3
Preparations for teams
As a team, you need to make sure that your software can run on Ubuntu 20.04 and without root permissions.
If you require a GPU or have other specific requirements, ask the technical committee if it will be possible.
Each team has its own docker container including a simple desktop environment.
If you need additional libraries to run and/or build your software, create a custom docker image based on 
src/ubuntu-vnc
. Use 
src/ubuntu-vnc-java
 as a template. Then submit a pull-request with the new docker image.
It is possible to copy files into the container, so you can also build your software locally and only copy the binaries over.
Your container will have a volume mounted to the home folder. The volume will be used for all fields, while there will be individual containers per field. You do not need to worry about changing any network addresses or ports, they will always be the same.
You should be able to handle multiple network interfaces, though.
To integrate your own container, add a new service to 
docker-compose-teams.yaml
. Take the tigers or erforce service as a template.
Also, add your team name to 
config/teams
. It should be all-lower-case without any special characters.
Setup
If you want to use a remote server, change the root domain and field name first in 
./config/root_domain
 and 
./config/field_name
. Else, the defaults are fine.
Before you start anything, you need to initialize some secrets with:
./config/docker/init.sh
This will generate passwords and an SSH key and put them at the right places.
Next, generate the initial Caddyfile for the webserver:
#
 You may need/want to have a virtual environment to make python dependencies available (or install it globally)
python3 -m venv .venv
source
 .venv/bin/activate
pip install jinja2 requests
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
Now, you can spin up the field:
#
 Start all containers and keep showing the log in the foreground (ctrl+c will stop everything again)
docker compose up
#
 Or alternatively run all containers in the background:
docker compose up -d
Next, setup Guacamole and caddy:
#
 Sets up the running Guacamole (VNC) server. Will also generate team passwords.
./config/guacamole/update_guacamole.py
#
 Convert all passwords into a caddy format for the game-controller
./config/caddy/update_caddy_passwords.sh
#
 Regenerate the Caddyfile with the newly created passwords
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
#
 Reload the running caddy webserver
./config/caddy/update_caddy_config.sh
Finally, spin up the team containers that you need:
#
 Start team containers (individually or all together)
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up [team-container]
If you want to have additional monitoring, you can also start the monitoring containers:
#
 Start monitoring containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-monitoring.yaml up
Access
You can access the field through your browser now.
The URL is 
https://localhost
 or whatever you chose as the root domain.
If you are running locally, you might want to add the local CA from caddy to your system with:
#
 Note: Have a look at this script for more details
./caddy/install_local_CA.sh
All credentials were generated to 
./config/passwords
.
Usage notes
In Guacamole, you can press Ctrl + Shift + Alt to open a menu where you can copy files from/to the VNC session.
You can also drag&drop files into the browser tab to copy files into the home folder
The home folder is backed by a volume, so all files in the home folder will survive container rebuilds
To paste text into the terminal, use Shift+Insert
Shutdown and cleanup
Stop and remove all containers, networks and volumes (
-v
) for a specific field:
docker compose down -v
Run on AWS
The full setup can be deployed to AWS with terraform:
cd
 terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
Make sure to make yourself familiar with AWS and terraform, before doing this. Most notably:
You have to install AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials
You have to add your public key to 
./terraform/scripts/bootstrap.yaml
 to be able to SSH into the instances
You have to configure a domain and point it to the public IP that is returned by terraform
You have to set the required TF variables
You can connect to the instances with:
ssh terraform@
<
public-ip
>
#
 Check the cloud-init log
less /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
#
 Go to setup folder
cd
 ssl-simulation-setup
#
 Start team containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up -d [team-container]
To destroy the setup, run:
terraform destroy
Update
The database setup scripts are pre-generated already, but if
the guacamole version changes, the script might need to be generated again with:
docker run --rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --postgresql 
>
 init/postgres/01_initdb.sql

Simulation Setup for virtual Small Size League Tournament
This repository contains the configuration for a virtual Small Size League tournament
with multiple fields and all components that are required.
Setup idea
A single powerful root server is used per field
Teams only access the server via Browser with Guacamole
A team has access to its own VNC session (a virtual desktop)
All teams have view access to all VNC sessions, to make sure nobody is touching their system during a match
A team may submit a custom docker image with additional dependencies
The home folder is backed by a docker volume. Teams can check out their code here, and it will survive container restarts and rebuilds
The field can be viewed with the ssl-vision-client in the browser
The ssl-status-board shows the game state in the browser
The ssl-game-controller is protected with user/password. Only the refereeing team and the admin is activated per match.
The 
ssl-simulation-controller
 manages manual ball and robot placement and simulation configuration
Requirements
Following software is required, which should be available on all major operating systems:
Docker and Docker-Compose
Bash
Python 3
Preparations for teams
As a team, you need to make sure that your software can run on Ubuntu 20.04 and without root permissions.
If you require a GPU or have other specific requirements, ask the technical committee if it will be possible.
Each team has its own docker container including a simple desktop environment.
If you need additional libraries to run and/or build your software, create a custom docker image based on 
src/ubuntu-vnc
. Use 
src/ubuntu-vnc-java
 as a template. Then submit a pull-request with the new docker image.
It is possible to copy files into the container, so you can also build your software locally and only copy the binaries over.
Your container will have a volume mounted to the home folder. The volume will be used for all fields, while there will be individual containers per field. You do not need to worry about changing any network addresses or ports, they will always be the same.
You should be able to handle multiple network interfaces, though.
To integrate your own container, add a new service to 
docker-compose-teams.yaml
. Take the tigers or erforce service as a template.
Also, add your team name to 
config/teams
. It should be all-lower-case without any special characters.
Setup
If you want to use a remote server, change the root domain and field name first in 
./config/root_domain
 and 
./config/field_name
. Else, the defaults are fine.
Before you start anything, you need to initialize some secrets with:
./config/docker/init.sh
This will generate passwords and an SSH key and put them at the right places.
Next, generate the initial Caddyfile for the webserver:
#
 You may need/want to have a virtual environment to make python dependencies available (or install it globally)
python3 -m venv .venv
source
 .venv/bin/activate
pip install jinja2 requests
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
Now, you can spin up the field:
#
 Start all containers and keep showing the log in the foreground (ctrl+c will stop everything again)
docker compose up
#
 Or alternatively run all containers in the background:
docker compose up -d
Next, setup Guacamole and caddy:
#
 Sets up the running Guacamole (VNC) server. Will also generate team passwords.
./config/guacamole/update_guacamole.py
#
 Convert all passwords into a caddy format for the game-controller
./config/caddy/update_caddy_passwords.sh
#
 Regenerate the Caddyfile with the newly created passwords
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
#
 Reload the running caddy webserver
./config/caddy/update_caddy_config.sh
Finally, spin up the team containers that you need:
#
 Start team containers (individually or all together)
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up [team-container]
If you want to have additional monitoring, you can also start the monitoring containers:
#
 Start monitoring containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-monitoring.yaml up
Access
You can access the field through your browser now.
The URL is 
https://localhost
 or whatever you chose as the root domain.
If you are running locally, you might want to add the local CA from caddy to your system with:
#
 Note: Have a look at this script for more details
./caddy/install_local_CA.sh
All credentials were generated to 
./config/passwords
.
Usage notes
In Guacamole, you can press Ctrl + Shift + Alt to open a menu where you can copy files from/to the VNC session.
You can also drag&drop files into the browser tab to copy files into the home folder
The home folder is backed by a volume, so all files in the home folder will survive container rebuilds
To paste text into the terminal, use Shift+Insert
Shutdown and cleanup
Stop and remove all containers, networks and volumes (
-v
) for a specific field:
docker compose down -v
Run on AWS
The full setup can be deployed to AWS with terraform:
cd
 terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
Make sure to make yourself familiar with AWS and terraform, before doing this. Most notably:
You have to install AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials
You have to add your public key to 
./terraform/scripts/bootstrap.yaml
 to be able to SSH into the instances
You have to configure a domain and point it to the public IP that is returned by terraform
You have to set the required TF variables
You can connect to the instances with:
ssh terraform@
<
public-ip
>
#
 Check the cloud-init log
less /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
#
 Go to setup folder
cd
 ssl-simulation-setup
#
 Start team containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up -d [team-container]
To destroy the setup, run:
terraform destroy
Update
The database setup scripts are pre-generated already, but if
the guacamole version changes, the script might need to be generated again with:
docker run --rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --postgresql 
>
 init/postgres/01_initdb.sql

Make sure to make yourself familiar with AWS and terraform, before doing this. Most notably:
You have to install AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials
You have to add your public key to 
./terraform/scripts/bootstrap.yaml
 to be able to SSH into the instances
You have to configure a domain and point it to the public IP that is returned by terraform
You have to set the required TF variables
You can connect to the instances with:

Simulation Setup for virtual Small Size League Tournament
This repository contains the configuration for a virtual Small Size League tournament
with multiple fields and all components that are required.
Setup idea
A single powerful root server is used per field
Teams only access the server via Browser with Guacamole
A team has access to its own VNC session (a virtual desktop)
All teams have view access to all VNC sessions, to make sure nobody is touching their system during a match
A team may submit a custom docker image with additional dependencies
The home folder is backed by a docker volume. Teams can check out their code here, and it will survive container restarts and rebuilds
The field can be viewed with the ssl-vision-client in the browser
The ssl-status-board shows the game state in the browser
The ssl-game-controller is protected with user/password. Only the refereeing team and the admin is activated per match.
The 
ssl-simulation-controller
 manages manual ball and robot placement and simulation configuration
Requirements
Following software is required, which should be available on all major operating systems:
Docker and Docker-Compose
Bash
Python 3
Preparations for teams
As a team, you need to make sure that your software can run on Ubuntu 20.04 and without root permissions.
If you require a GPU or have other specific requirements, ask the technical committee if it will be possible.
Each team has its own docker container including a simple desktop environment.
If you need additional libraries to run and/or build your software, create a custom docker image based on 
src/ubuntu-vnc
. Use 
src/ubuntu-vnc-java
 as a template. Then submit a pull-request with the new docker image.
It is possible to copy files into the container, so you can also build your software locally and only copy the binaries over.
Your container will have a volume mounted to the home folder. The volume will be used for all fields, while there will be individual containers per field. You do not need to worry about changing any network addresses or ports, they will always be the same.
You should be able to handle multiple network interfaces, though.
To integrate your own container, add a new service to 
docker-compose-teams.yaml
. Take the tigers or erforce service as a template.
Also, add your team name to 
config/teams
. It should be all-lower-case without any special characters.
Setup
If you want to use a remote server, change the root domain and field name first in 
./config/root_domain
 and 
./config/field_name
. Else, the defaults are fine.
Before you start anything, you need to initialize some secrets with:
./config/docker/init.sh
This will generate passwords and an SSH key and put them at the right places.
Next, generate the initial Caddyfile for the webserver:
#
 You may need/want to have a virtual environment to make python dependencies available (or install it globally)
python3 -m venv .venv
source
 .venv/bin/activate
pip install jinja2 requests
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
Now, you can spin up the field:
#
 Start all containers and keep showing the log in the foreground (ctrl+c will stop everything again)
docker compose up
#
 Or alternatively run all containers in the background:
docker compose up -d
Next, setup Guacamole and caddy:
#
 Sets up the running Guacamole (VNC) server. Will also generate team passwords.
./config/guacamole/update_guacamole.py
#
 Convert all passwords into a caddy format for the game-controller
./config/caddy/update_caddy_passwords.sh
#
 Regenerate the Caddyfile with the newly created passwords
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
#
 Reload the running caddy webserver
./config/caddy/update_caddy_config.sh
Finally, spin up the team containers that you need:
#
 Start team containers (individually or all together)
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up [team-container]
If you want to have additional monitoring, you can also start the monitoring containers:
#
 Start monitoring containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-monitoring.yaml up
Access
You can access the field through your browser now.
The URL is 
https://localhost
 or whatever you chose as the root domain.
If you are running locally, you might want to add the local CA from caddy to your system with:
#
 Note: Have a look at this script for more details
./caddy/install_local_CA.sh
All credentials were generated to 
./config/passwords
.
Usage notes
In Guacamole, you can press Ctrl + Shift + Alt to open a menu where you can copy files from/to the VNC session.
You can also drag&drop files into the browser tab to copy files into the home folder
The home folder is backed by a volume, so all files in the home folder will survive container rebuilds
To paste text into the terminal, use Shift+Insert
Shutdown and cleanup
Stop and remove all containers, networks and volumes (
-v
) for a specific field:
docker compose down -v
Run on AWS
The full setup can be deployed to AWS with terraform:
cd
 terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
Make sure to make yourself familiar with AWS and terraform, before doing this. Most notably:
You have to install AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials
You have to add your public key to 
./terraform/scripts/bootstrap.yaml
 to be able to SSH into the instances
You have to configure a domain and point it to the public IP that is returned by terraform
You have to set the required TF variables
You can connect to the instances with:
ssh terraform@
<
public-ip
>
#
 Check the cloud-init log
less /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
#
 Go to setup folder
cd
 ssl-simulation-setup
#
 Start team containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up -d [team-container]
To destroy the setup, run:
terraform destroy
Update
The database setup scripts are pre-generated already, but if
the guacamole version changes, the script might need to be generated again with:
docker run --rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --postgresql 
>
 init/postgres/01_initdb.sql

The 
ssl-simulation-controller
 manages manual ball and robot placement and simulation configuration
Requirements
Following software is required, which should be available on all major operating systems:
Docker and Docker-Compose
Bash
Python 3
Preparations for teams
As a team, you need to make sure that your software can run on Ubuntu 20.04 and without root permissions.
If you require a GPU or have other specific requirements, ask the technical committee if it will be possible.
Each team has its own docker container including a simple desktop environment.
If you need additional libraries to run and/or build your software, create a custom docker image based on 
src/ubuntu-vnc
. Use 
src/ubuntu-vnc-java
 as a template. Then submit a pull-request with the new docker image.
It is possible to copy files into the container, so you can also build your software locally and only copy the binaries over.
Your container will have a volume mounted to the home folder. The volume will be used for all fields, while there will be individual containers per field. You do not need to worry about changing any network addresses or ports, they will always be the same.
You should be able to handle multiple network interfaces, though.
To integrate your own container, add a new service to 
docker-compose-teams.yaml
. Take the tigers or erforce service as a template.
Also, add your team name to 
config/teams
. It should be all-lower-case without any special characters.
Setup
If you want to use a remote server, change the root domain and field name first in 
./config/root_domain
 and 
./config/field_name
. Else, the defaults are fine.
Before you start anything, you need to initialize some secrets with:
./config/docker/init.sh
This will generate passwords and an SSH key and put them at the right places.
Next, generate the initial Caddyfile for the webserver:
#
 You may need/want to have a virtual environment to make python dependencies available (or install it globally)
python3 -m venv .venv
source
 .venv/bin/activate
pip install jinja2 requests
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
Now, you can spin up the field:
#
 Start all containers and keep showing the log in the foreground (ctrl+c will stop everything again)
docker compose up
#
 Or alternatively run all containers in the background:
docker compose up -d
Next, setup Guacamole and caddy:
#
 Sets up the running Guacamole (VNC) server. Will also generate team passwords.
./config/guacamole/update_guacamole.py
#
 Convert all passwords into a caddy format for the game-controller
./config/caddy/update_caddy_passwords.sh
#
 Regenerate the Caddyfile with the newly created passwords
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
#
 Reload the running caddy webserver
./config/caddy/update_caddy_config.sh
Finally, spin up the team containers that you need:
#
 Start team containers (individually or all together)
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up [team-container]
If you want to have additional monitoring, you can also start the monitoring containers:
#
 Start monitoring containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-monitoring.yaml up
Access
You can access the field through your browser now.
The URL is 
https://localhost
 or whatever you chose as the root domain.
If you are running locally, you might want to add the local CA from caddy to your system with:
#
 Note: Have a look at this script for more details
./caddy/install_local_CA.sh
All credentials were generated to 
./config/passwords
.
Usage notes
In Guacamole, you can press Ctrl + Shift + Alt to open a menu where you can copy files from/to the VNC session.
You can also drag&drop files into the browser tab to copy files into the home folder
The home folder is backed by a volume, so all files in the home folder will survive container rebuilds
To paste text into the terminal, use Shift+Insert
Shutdown and cleanup
Stop and remove all containers, networks and volumes (
-v
) for a specific field:
docker compose down -v
Run on AWS
The full setup can be deployed to AWS with terraform:
cd
 terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
Make sure to make yourself familiar with AWS and terraform, before doing this. Most notably:
You have to install AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials
You have to add your public key to 
./terraform/scripts/bootstrap.yaml
 to be able to SSH into the instances
You have to configure a domain and point it to the public IP that is returned by terraform
You have to set the required TF variables
You can connect to the instances with:
ssh terraform@
<
public-ip
>
#
 Check the cloud-init log
less /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
#
 Go to setup folder
cd
 ssl-simulation-setup
#
 Start team containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up -d [team-container]
To destroy the setup, run:
terraform destroy
Update
The database setup scripts are pre-generated already, but if
the guacamole version changes, the script might need to be generated again with:
docker run --rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --postgresql 
>
 init/postgres/01_initdb.sql

Simulation Setup for virtual Small Size League Tournament
This repository contains the configuration for a virtual Small Size League tournament
with multiple fields and all components that are required.
Setup idea
A single powerful root server is used per field
Teams only access the server via Browser with Guacamole
A team has access to its own VNC session (a virtual desktop)
All teams have view access to all VNC sessions, to make sure nobody is touching their system during a match
A team may submit a custom docker image with additional dependencies
The home folder is backed by a docker volume. Teams can check out their code here, and it will survive container restarts and rebuilds
The field can be viewed with the ssl-vision-client in the browser
The ssl-status-board shows the game state in the browser
The ssl-game-controller is protected with user/password. Only the refereeing team and the admin is activated per match.
The 
ssl-simulation-controller
 manages manual ball and robot placement and simulation configuration

Simulation Setup for virtual Small Size League Tournament
This repository contains the configuration for a virtual Small Size League tournament
with multiple fields and all components that are required.
Setup idea
A single powerful root server is used per field
Teams only access the server via Browser with Guacamole
A team has access to its own VNC session (a virtual desktop)
All teams have view access to all VNC sessions, to make sure nobody is touching their system during a match
A team may submit a custom docker image with additional dependencies
The home folder is backed by a docker volume. Teams can check out their code here, and it will survive container restarts and rebuilds
The field can be viewed with the ssl-vision-client in the browser
The ssl-status-board shows the game state in the browser
The ssl-game-controller is protected with user/password. Only the refereeing team and the admin is activated per match.
The 
ssl-simulation-controller
 manages manual ball and robot placement and simulation configuration
Requirements
Following software is required, which should be available on all major operating systems:
Docker and Docker-Compose
Bash
Python 3
Preparations for teams
As a team, you need to make sure that your software can run on Ubuntu 20.04 and without root permissions.
If you require a GPU or have other specific requirements, ask the technical committee if it will be possible.
Each team has its own docker container including a simple desktop environment.
If you need additional libraries to run and/or build your software, create a custom docker image based on 
src/ubuntu-vnc
. Use 
src/ubuntu-vnc-java
 as a template. Then submit a pull-request with the new docker image.
It is possible to copy files into the container, so you can also build your software locally and only copy the binaries over.
Your container will have a volume mounted to the home folder. The volume will be used for all fields, while there will be individual containers per field. You do not need to worry about changing any network addresses or ports, they will always be the same.
You should be able to handle multiple network interfaces, though.
To integrate your own container, add a new service to 
docker-compose-teams.yaml
. Take the tigers or erforce service as a template.
Also, add your team name to 
config/teams
. It should be all-lower-case without any special characters.
Setup
If you want to use a remote server, change the root domain and field name first in 
./config/root_domain
 and 
./config/field_name
. Else, the defaults are fine.
Before you start anything, you need to initialize some secrets with:
./config/docker/init.sh
This will generate passwords and an SSH key and put them at the right places.
Next, generate the initial Caddyfile for the webserver:
#
 You may need/want to have a virtual environment to make python dependencies available (or install it globally)
python3 -m venv .venv
source
 .venv/bin/activate
pip install jinja2 requests
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
Now, you can spin up the field:
#
 Start all containers and keep showing the log in the foreground (ctrl+c will stop everything again)
docker compose up
#
 Or alternatively run all containers in the background:
docker compose up -d
Next, setup Guacamole and caddy:
#
 Sets up the running Guacamole (VNC) server. Will also generate team passwords.
./config/guacamole/update_guacamole.py
#
 Convert all passwords into a caddy format for the game-controller
./config/caddy/update_caddy_passwords.sh
#
 Regenerate the Caddyfile with the newly created passwords
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
#
 Reload the running caddy webserver
./config/caddy/update_caddy_config.sh
Finally, spin up the team containers that you need:
#
 Start team containers (individually or all together)
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up [team-container]
If you want to have additional monitoring, you can also start the monitoring containers:
#
 Start monitoring containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-monitoring.yaml up
Access
You can access the field through your browser now.
The URL is 
https://localhost
 or whatever you chose as the root domain.
If you are running locally, you might want to add the local CA from caddy to your system with:
#
 Note: Have a look at this script for more details
./caddy/install_local_CA.sh
All credentials were generated to 
./config/passwords
.
Usage notes
In Guacamole, you can press Ctrl + Shift + Alt to open a menu where you can copy files from/to the VNC session.
You can also drag&drop files into the browser tab to copy files into the home folder
The home folder is backed by a volume, so all files in the home folder will survive container rebuilds
To paste text into the terminal, use Shift+Insert
Shutdown and cleanup
Stop and remove all containers, networks and volumes (
-v
) for a specific field:
docker compose down -v
Run on AWS
The full setup can be deployed to AWS with terraform:
cd
 terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
Make sure to make yourself familiar with AWS and terraform, before doing this. Most notably:
You have to install AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials
You have to add your public key to 
./terraform/scripts/bootstrap.yaml
 to be able to SSH into the instances
You have to configure a domain and point it to the public IP that is returned by terraform
You have to set the required TF variables
You can connect to the instances with:
ssh terraform@
<
public-ip
>
#
 Check the cloud-init log
less /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
#
 Go to setup folder
cd
 ssl-simulation-setup
#
 Start team containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up -d [team-container]
To destroy the setup, run:
terraform destroy
Update
The database setup scripts are pre-generated already, but if
the guacamole version changes, the script might need to be generated again with:
docker run --rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --postgresql 
>
 init/postgres/01_initdb.sql

Simulation Setup for virtual Small Size League Tournament
This repository contains the configuration for a virtual Small Size League tournament
with multiple fields and all components that are required.
Setup idea
A single powerful root server is used per field
Teams only access the server via Browser with Guacamole
A team has access to its own VNC session (a virtual desktop)
All teams have view access to all VNC sessions, to make sure nobody is touching their system during a match
A team may submit a custom docker image with additional dependencies
The home folder is backed by a docker volume. Teams can check out their code here, and it will survive container restarts and rebuilds
The field can be viewed with the ssl-vision-client in the browser
The ssl-status-board shows the game state in the browser
The ssl-game-controller is protected with user/password. Only the refereeing team and the admin is activated per match.
The 
ssl-simulation-controller
 manages manual ball and robot placement and simulation configuration
Requirements
Following software is required, which should be available on all major operating systems:
Docker and Docker-Compose
Bash
Python 3
Preparations for teams
As a team, you need to make sure that your software can run on Ubuntu 20.04 and without root permissions.
If you require a GPU or have other specific requirements, ask the technical committee if it will be possible.
Each team has its own docker container including a simple desktop environment.
If you need additional libraries to run and/or build your software, create a custom docker image based on 
src/ubuntu-vnc
. Use 
src/ubuntu-vnc-java
 as a template. Then submit a pull-request with the new docker image.
It is possible to copy files into the container, so you can also build your software locally and only copy the binaries over.
Your container will have a volume mounted to the home folder. The volume will be used for all fields, while there will be individual containers per field. You do not need to worry about changing any network addresses or ports, they will always be the same.
You should be able to handle multiple network interfaces, though.
To integrate your own container, add a new service to 
docker-compose-teams.yaml
. Take the tigers or erforce service as a template.
Also, add your team name to 
config/teams
. It should be all-lower-case without any special characters.
Setup
If you want to use a remote server, change the root domain and field name first in 
./config/root_domain
 and 
./config/field_name
. Else, the defaults are fine.
Before you start anything, you need to initialize some secrets with:
./config/docker/init.sh
This will generate passwords and an SSH key and put them at the right places.
Next, generate the initial Caddyfile for the webserver:
#
 You may need/want to have a virtual environment to make python dependencies available (or install it globally)
python3 -m venv .venv
source
 .venv/bin/activate
pip install jinja2 requests
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
Now, you can spin up the field:
#
 Start all containers and keep showing the log in the foreground (ctrl+c will stop everything again)
docker compose up
#
 Or alternatively run all containers in the background:
docker compose up -d
Next, setup Guacamole and caddy:
#
 Sets up the running Guacamole (VNC) server. Will also generate team passwords.
./config/guacamole/update_guacamole.py
#
 Convert all passwords into a caddy format for the game-controller
./config/caddy/update_caddy_passwords.sh
#
 Regenerate the Caddyfile with the newly created passwords
./config/caddy/generate_caddyfile.py
#
 Reload the running caddy webserver
./config/caddy/update_caddy_config.sh
Finally, spin up the team containers that you need:
#
 Start team containers (individually or all together)
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up [team-container]
If you want to have additional monitoring, you can also start the monitoring containers:
#
 Start monitoring containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-monitoring.yaml up
Access
You can access the field through your browser now.
The URL is 
https://localhost
 or whatever you chose as the root domain.
If you are running locally, you might want to add the local CA from caddy to your system with:
#
 Note: Have a look at this script for more details
./caddy/install_local_CA.sh
All credentials were generated to 
./config/passwords
.
Usage notes
In Guacamole, you can press Ctrl + Shift + Alt to open a menu where you can copy files from/to the VNC session.
You can also drag&drop files into the browser tab to copy files into the home folder
The home folder is backed by a volume, so all files in the home folder will survive container rebuilds
To paste text into the terminal, use Shift+Insert
Shutdown and cleanup
Stop and remove all containers, networks and volumes (
-v
) for a specific field:
docker compose down -v
Run on AWS
The full setup can be deployed to AWS with terraform:
cd
 terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
Make sure to make yourself familiar with AWS and terraform, before doing this. Most notably:
You have to install AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials
You have to add your public key to 
./terraform/scripts/bootstrap.yaml
 to be able to SSH into the instances
You have to configure a domain and point it to the public IP that is returned by terraform
You have to set the required TF variables
You can connect to the instances with:
ssh terraform@
<
public-ip
>
#
 Check the cloud-init log
less /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
#
 Go to setup folder
cd
 ssl-simulation-setup
#
 Start team containers
docker compose -f docker-compose-teams.yaml up -d [team-container]
To destroy the setup, run:
terraform destroy
Update
The database setup scripts are pre-generated already, but if
the guacamole version changes, the script might need to be generated again with:
docker run --rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --postgresql 
>
 init/postgres/01_initdb.sql

SSL Status Board
A Status Board for the Small Size League, optimized to show the current game state on a large screen.
Adding your teams logo
If you would like to see your teams logo on the status-board, add it to 
frontend/src/assets/logos
 and include it in 
frontend/src/teamLogoUrl.js
.
The team name must match the one configured in the ssl-game-controller in all lowercase.
Usage
If you just want to use this app, simply download the latest 
release binary
.
The binary is self-contained. No dependencies are required.
You can also use pre-build docker images:
docker pull robocupssl/ssl-status-board
docker run -p 8082:8082 robocupssl/ssl-status-board
By default, the UI is available at 
http://localhost:8082
A configuration file will be generated to 
config/board-config.yaml
 and can be tweaked.
Runtime Requirements
No software dependencies (except for development, see below)
64bit Linux, Windows, OSX (build your 32bit binaries yourself...)
A reasonable Web-Browser (mostly tested on Chrome)
Development
Requirements
You need to install following dependencies first:
Go
Node
See 
.circleci/config.yml
 for compatible versions.
Frontend
See 
frontend/README.md
Build
Build and install all binaries:
make install
Run
Build and run main binary:
make run

Crunching the latest data, just for you. Hang tight…
We don’t have enough data to show anything useful.
It usually takes about a week to populate this graph.
There are too many commits to generate this graph.
More information about this data can be found in the
activity documentation
.
We need at least one non-empty commit with an email to generate this graph.
We tried our best, but the graph wouldn’t load. Try reloading the page.

This comparison is taking too long to generate.
Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.
You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine: 
git diff v2.12.2...v2.12.3

SSL Status Board
A Status Board for the Small Size League, optimized to show the current game state on a large screen.
Adding your teams logo
If you would like to see your teams logo on the status-board, add it to 
frontend/src/assets/logos
 and include it in 
frontend/src/teamLogoUrl.js
.
The team name must match the one configured in the ssl-game-controller in all lowercase.
Usage
If you just want to use this app, simply download the latest 
release binary
.
The binary is self-contained. No dependencies are required.
You can also use pre-build docker images:
docker pull robocupssl/ssl-status-board
docker run -p 8082:8082 robocupssl/ssl-status-board
By default, the UI is available at 
http://localhost:8082
A configuration file will be generated to 
config/board-config.yaml
 and can be tweaked.
Runtime Requirements
No software dependencies (except for development, see below)
64bit Linux, Windows, OSX (build your 32bit binaries yourself...)
A reasonable Web-Browser (mostly tested on Chrome)
Development
Requirements
You need to install following dependencies first:
Go
Node
See 
.circleci/config.yml
 for compatible versions.
Frontend
See 
frontend/README.md

SSL Status Board
A Status Board for the Small Size League, optimized to show the current game state on a large screen.
Adding your teams logo
If you would like to see your teams logo on the status-board, add it to

The binary is self-contained. No dependencies are required.
You can also use pre-build docker images:
docker pull robocupssl/ssl-status-board
docker run -p 8082:8082 robocupssl/ssl-status-board
By default, the UI is available at 
http://localhost:8082
A configuration file will be generated to 
config/board-config.yaml
 and can be tweaked.
Runtime Requirements
No software dependencies (except for development, see below)
64bit Linux, Windows, OSX (build your 32bit binaries yourself...)
A reasonable Web-Browser (mostly tested on Chrome)

ssl-match-stats
A tool that generates statistics from 
official SSL log files
.
Requirements
You need to install following dependencies:
Go
Usage
Build
#
 Build the binaries and install them in $GOPATH/bin
make install
Generate Statistics
The 
ssl-match-stats
 command will generate the statistics into an intermediate data structure 
*.{json|bin}
from which they can be exported. This must be done per tournament and division.
The command takes a list of log files as input:
mkdir -p stats
ssl-match-stats -parallel 16 -targetDir stats *.log.gz
Import Statistics into a Database
The generated statistics can be exported into a PostgreSQL database.
This makes it easier to query and analyze the data.
The command requires some parameters:
tournament: A unique name for the tournament of the log files, for example 'RoboCup2019'
division: The division of the log files, one of: 'DivA', 'DivB', 'none'
sqlDbSource: A connection string to the target database
ssl-match-stats-db \
 -parallel=16 \
 -sqlDbSource=
"
postgres://ssl_match_stats:ssl_match_stats@localhost:5432/ssl_match_stats?sslmode=disable
"
 \
 -tournament=Test \
 -division=DivA \
 stats/
*
.bin
Local Setup
Use the provided compose setup to run the database and metabase locally.
docker compose up -d
The database connection string
is: 
postgres://ssl_match_stats:ssl_match_stats@localhost:5432/ssl_match_stats?sslmode=disable
Remote Setup
The host the statistics one a server, following the below instructions.
See 
Setup for Match Stats DB
 for instructions on setting up the PostgreSQL database.
See 
Setup for Metabase
 for instructions on setting up Metabase, an open-source BI
software.
Manual data correction
If you want to evaluate the start time offset between scheduled match start time and actual start time,
you need to add the scheduled time into 
matches.start_time_planned
 manually.
Protobuf
To generate the sources from the 
.proto
 files, run 
make proto
.
Implementation Details
This tool reads log files one by one with the 
ssl-match-stats
 command and creates a protobuf file based
on 
ssl_match_stats.proto
.
This structure contains a 
MatchStats
 object per match (log file), which contains:
Some meta data like name, duration, etc.
A list of all game phases (which map roughly to referee commands)
TeamStats
 for each team
The incentive is that the 
MatchStats
 structure contains an improved representation of the referee messages
for further processing. The match is split into game phases, where a new game phase is started for each new command
(except the goal commands). Each game phase has metadata, entry and exit states and game events attached to it.
TeamStats
 contain aggregated final counters and timers.
With this improved representation, the data can be exported for further analysis.

We don’t have enough data to show anything useful.
It usually takes about a week to populate this graph.
There are too many commits to generate this graph.
More information about this data can be found in the

We need at least one non-empty commit with an email to generate this graph.
We tried our best, but the graph wouldn’t load. Try reloading the page.

### 
Generate statistics from log files
31
+
32
+
Pass in a list of log files to be processed: 
`
ssl-match-stats -generate *.log.gz
`
33
+
34
+
### 
Export statistics to CSV files
35
+
36
+
First, generate the statistics with the command above. This will produce a 
`
out.json
`
 and 
`
out.bin
`
 file.
37
+
38
+
Run: 
`
ssl-match-stats -exportCsv
`
39
+
40
+
This will generate 
`
*.csv
`
 files that you can import in your favorite tool, like a spreadsheet tool.

ssl-match-stats
A tool that generates statistics from 
official SSL log files
.
Requirements
You need to install following dependencies:
Go
Usage
Build
#
 Build the binaries and install them in $GOPATH/bin
make install
Generate Statistics
The 
ssl-match-stats
 command will generate the statistics into an intermediate data structure 
*.{json|bin}
from which they can be exported. This must be done per tournament and division.
The command takes a list of log files as input:
mkdir -p stats
ssl-match-stats -parallel 16 -targetDir stats *.log.gz
Import Statistics into a Database
The generated statistics can be exported into a PostgreSQL database.
This makes it easier to query and analyze the data.
The command requires some parameters:
tournament: A unique name for the tournament of the log files, for example 'RoboCup2019'
division: The division of the log files, one of: 'DivA', 'DivB', 'none'
sqlDbSource: A connection string to the target database
ssl-match-stats-db \
 -parallel=16 \
 -sqlDbSource=
"
postgres://ssl_match_stats:ssl_match_stats@localhost:5432/ssl_match_stats?sslmode=disable
"
 \
 -tournament=Test \
 -division=DivA \
 stats/
*
.bin
Local Setup
Use the provided compose setup to run the database and metabase locally.
docker compose up -d
The database connection string
is: 
postgres://ssl_match_stats:ssl_match_stats@localhost:5432/ssl_match_stats?sslmode=disable
Remote Setup
The host the statistics one a server, following the below instructions.
See 
Setup for Match Stats DB
 for instructions on setting up the PostgreSQL database.
See 
Setup for Metabase
 for instructions on setting up Metabase, an open-source BI
software.
Manual data correction
If you want to evaluate the start time offset between scheduled match start time and actual start time,
you need to add the scheduled time into 
matches.start_time_planned
 manually.
Protobuf
To generate the sources from the 
.proto
 files, run 
make proto
.
Implementation Details
This tool reads log files one by one with the 
ssl-match-stats
 command and creates a protobuf file based
on 
ssl_match_stats.proto
.
This structure contains a 
MatchStats
 object per match (log file), which contains:
Some meta data like name, duration, etc.
A list of all game phases (which map roughly to referee commands)
TeamStats
 for each team
The incentive is that the 
MatchStats
 structure contains an improved representation of the referee messages
for further processing. The match is split into game phases, where a new game phase is started for each new command
(except the goal commands). Each game phase has metadata, entry and exit states and game events attached to it.
TeamStats
 contain aggregated final counters and timers.
With this improved representation, the data can be exported for further analysis.

ssl-match-stats
A tool that generates statistics from 
official SSL log files
.
Requirements
You need to install following dependencies:
Go
Usage
Build
#
 Build the binaries and install them in $GOPATH/bin
make install
Generate Statistics
The 
ssl-match-stats
 command will generate the statistics into an intermediate data structure 
*.{json|bin}
from which they can be exported. This must be done per tournament and division.
The command takes a list of log files as input:
mkdir -p stats
ssl-match-stats -parallel 16 -targetDir stats *.log.gz
Import Statistics into a Database
The generated statistics can be exported into a PostgreSQL database.
This makes it easier to query and analyze the data.
The command requires some parameters:
tournament: A unique name for the tournament of the log files, for example 'RoboCup2019'
division: The division of the log files, one of: 'DivA', 'DivB', 'none'
sqlDbSource: A connection string to the target database
ssl-match-stats-db \
 -parallel=16 \
 -sqlDbSource=
"
postgres://ssl_match_stats:ssl_match_stats@localhost:5432/ssl_match_stats?sslmode=disable
"
 \
 -tournament=Test \
 -division=DivA \
 stats/
*
.bin
Local Setup
Use the provided compose setup to run the database and metabase locally.
docker compose up -d
The database connection string
is: 
postgres://ssl_match_stats:ssl_match_stats@localhost:5432/ssl_match_stats?sslmode=disable
Remote Setup
The host the statistics one a server, following the below instructions.
See 
Setup for Match Stats DB
 for instructions on setting up the PostgreSQL database.
See 
Setup for Metabase
 for instructions on setting up Metabase, an open-source BI
software.
Manual data correction
If you want to evaluate the start time offset between scheduled match start time and actual start time,
you need to add the scheduled time into 
matches.start_time_planned
 manually.
Protobuf
To generate the sources from the 
.proto
 files, run 
make proto
.
Implementation Details
This tool reads log files one by one with the 
ssl-match-stats
 command and creates a protobuf file based
on 
ssl_match_stats.proto
.
This structure contains a 
MatchStats
 object per match (log file), which contains:
Some meta data like name, duration, etc.

for further processing. The match is split into game phases, where a new game phase is started for each new command
(except the goal commands). Each game phase has metadata, entry and exit states and game events attached to it.

ssl-match-stats
A tool that generates statistics from 
official SSL log files
.
Requirements
You need to install following dependencies:
Go
Usage
Build
#
 Build the binaries and install them in $GOPATH/bin
make install
Generate Statistics
The 
ssl-match-stats
 command will generate the statistics into an intermediate data structure 
*.{json|bin}
from which they can be exported. This must be done per tournament and division.
The command takes a list of log files as input:
mkdir -p stats
ssl-match-stats -parallel 16 -targetDir stats *.log.gz
Import Statistics into a Database
The generated statistics can be exported into a PostgreSQL database.
This makes it easier to query and analyze the data.
The command requires some parameters:
tournament: A unique name for the tournament of the log files, for example 'RoboCup2019'
division: The division of the log files, one of: 'DivA', 'DivB', 'none'
sqlDbSource: A connection string to the target database
ssl-match-stats-db \
 -parallel=16 \
 -sqlDbSource=
"
postgres://ssl_match_stats:ssl_match_stats@localhost:5432/ssl_match_stats?sslmode=disable
"
 \
 -tournament=Test \
 -division=DivA \
 stats/
*
.bin
Local Setup
Use the provided compose setup to run the database and metabase locally.
docker compose up -d
The database connection string
is: 
postgres://ssl_match_stats:ssl_match_stats@localhost:5432/ssl_match_stats?sslmode=disable
Remote Setup
The host the statistics one a server, following the below instructions.
See 
Setup for Match Stats DB
 for instructions on setting up the PostgreSQL database.
See 
Setup for Metabase
 for instructions on setting up Metabase, an open-source BI
software.
Manual data correction
If you want to evaluate the start time offset between scheduled match start time and actual start time,
you need to add the scheduled time into 
matches.start_time_planned
 manually.
Protobuf
To generate the sources from the 
.proto
 files, run 
make proto
.
Implementation Details
This tool reads log files one by one with the 
ssl-match-stats
 command and creates a protobuf file based
on 
ssl_match_stats.proto
.
This structure contains a 
MatchStats
 object per match (log file), which contains:
Some meta data like name, duration, etc.
A list of all game phases (which map roughly to referee commands)
TeamStats
 for each team
The incentive is that the 
MatchStats
 structure contains an improved representation of the referee messages
for further processing. The match is split into game phases, where a new game phase is started for each new command
(except the goal commands). Each game phase has metadata, entry and exit states and game events attached to it.
TeamStats
 contain aggregated final counters and timers.
With this improved representation, the data can be exported for further analysis.

ssl-match-stats
A tool that generates statistics from 
official SSL log files
.
Requirements
You need to install following dependencies:
Go
Usage
Build
#
 Build the binaries and install them in $GOPATH/bin
make install
Generate Statistics
The 
ssl-match-stats
 command will generate the statistics into an intermediate data structure 
*.{json|bin}
from which they can be exported. This must be done per tournament and division.
The command takes a list of log files as input:
mkdir -p stats
ssl-match-stats -parallel 16 -targetDir stats *.log.gz
Import Statistics into a Database
The generated statistics can be exported into a PostgreSQL database.
This makes it easier to query and analyze the data.
The command requires some parameters:
tournament: A unique name for the tournament of the log files, for example 'RoboCup2019'
division: The division of the log files, one of: 'DivA', 'DivB', 'none'
sqlDbSource: A connection string to the target database
ssl-match-stats-db \
 -parallel=16 \
 -sqlDbSource=
"
postgres://ssl_match_stats:ssl_match_stats@localhost:5432/ssl_match_stats?sslmode=disable
"
 \
 -tournament=Test \
 -division=DivA \
 stats/
*
.bin
Local Setup
Use the provided compose setup to run the database and metabase locally.
docker compose up -d
The database connection string
is: 
postgres://ssl_match_stats:ssl_match_stats@localhost:5432/ssl_match_stats?sslmode=disable
Remote Setup
The host the statistics one a server, following the below instructions.
See 
Setup for Match Stats DB
 for instructions on setting up the PostgreSQL database.
See 
Setup for Metabase
 for instructions on setting up Metabase, an open-source BI
software.
Manual data correction
If you want to evaluate the start time offset between scheduled match start time and actual start time,
you need to add the scheduled time into 
matches.start_time_planned
 manually.
Protobuf
To generate the sources from the 
.proto
 files, run 
make proto
.
Implementation Details
This tool reads log files one by one with the 
ssl-match-stats
 command and creates a protobuf file based
on 
ssl_match_stats.proto
.
This structure contains a 
MatchStats
 object per match (log file), which contains:
Some meta data like name, duration, etc.
A list of all game phases (which map roughly to referee commands)
TeamStats
 for each team
The incentive is that the 
MatchStats
 structure contains an improved representation of the referee messages
for further processing. The match is split into game phases, where a new game phase is started for each new command
(except the goal commands). Each game phase has metadata, entry and exit states and game events attached to it.
TeamStats
 contain aggregated final counters and timers.
With this improved representation, the data can be exported for further analysis.

ssl-match-stats
A tool that generates statistics from 
official SSL log files
.
Requirements
You need to install following dependencies:
Go
Usage
Build
#
 Build the binaries and install them in $GOPATH/bin
make install
Generate Statistics
The 
ssl-match-stats
 command will generate the statistics into an intermediate data structure 
*.{json|bin}
from which they can be exported. This must be done per tournament and division.
The command takes a list of log files as input:
mkdir -p stats
ssl-match-stats -parallel 16 -targetDir stats *.log.gz
Import Statistics into a Database
The generated statistics can be exported into a PostgreSQL database.
This makes it easier to query and analyze the data.
The command requires some parameters:
tournament: A unique name for the tournament of the log files, for example 'RoboCup2019'
division: The division of the log files, one of: 'DivA', 'DivB', 'none'
sqlDbSource: A connection string to the target database
ssl-match-stats-db \
 -parallel=16 \
 -sqlDbSource=
"
postgres://ssl_match_stats:ssl_match_stats@localhost:5432/ssl_match_stats?sslmode=disable
"
 \
 -tournament=Test \
 -division=DivA \
 stats/
*
.bin
Local Setup
Use the provided compose setup to run the database and metabase locally.
docker compose up -d
The database connection string
is: 
postgres://ssl_match_stats:ssl_match_stats@localhost:5432/ssl_match_stats?sslmode=disable
Remote Setup
The host the statistics one a server, following the below instructions.
See 
Setup for Match Stats DB
 for instructions on setting up the PostgreSQL database.
See 
Setup for Metabase
 for instructions on setting up Metabase, an open-source BI
software.
Manual data correction
If you want to evaluate the start time offset between scheduled match start time and actual start time,
you need to add the scheduled time into 
matches.start_time_planned
 manually.
Protobuf
To generate the sources from the 
.proto
 files, run 
make proto
.
Implementation Details
This tool reads log files one by one with the 
ssl-match-stats
 command and creates a protobuf file based
on 
ssl_match_stats.proto
.
This structure contains a 
MatchStats
 object per match (log file), which contains:
Some meta data like name, duration, etc.
A list of all game phases (which map roughly to referee commands)
TeamStats
 for each team
The incentive is that the 
MatchStats
 structure contains an improved representation of the referee messages
for further processing. The match is split into game phases, where a new game phase is started for each new command
(except the goal commands). Each game phase has metadata, entry and exit states and game events attached to it.
TeamStats
 contain aggregated final counters and timers.
With this improved representation, the data can be exported for further analysis.

Setup for Metabase
 for instructions on setting up Metabase, an open-source BI
software.
Manual data correction
If you want to evaluate the start time offset between scheduled match start time and actual start time,
you need to add the scheduled time into 
matches.start_time_planned
 manually.
Protobuf
To generate the sources from the 
.proto
 files, run 
make proto
.
Implementation Details
This tool reads log files one by one with the 
ssl-match-stats
 command and creates a protobuf file based
on 
ssl_match_stats.proto
.
This structure contains a 
MatchStats
 object per match (log file), which contains:
Some meta data like name, duration, etc.
A list of all game phases (which map roughly to referee commands)
TeamStats
 for each team
The incentive is that the 
MatchStats
 structure contains an improved representation of the referee messages
for further processing. The match is split into game phases, where a new game phase is started for each new command
(except the goal commands). Each game phase has metadata, entry and exit states and game events attached to it.
TeamStats
 contain aggregated final counters and timers.
With this improved representation, the data can be exported for further analysis.

ssl-match-stats
A tool that generates statistics from 
official SSL log files
.
Requirements
You need to install following dependencies:
Go
Usage
Build
#
 Build the binaries and install them in $GOPATH/bin
make install
Generate Statistics
The 
ssl-match-stats
 command will generate the statistics into an intermediate data structure 
*.{json|bin}
from which they can be exported. This must be done per tournament and division.
The command takes a list of log files as input:
mkdir -p stats
ssl-match-stats -parallel 16 -targetDir stats *.log.gz
Import Statistics into a Database
The generated statistics can be exported into a PostgreSQL database.
This makes it easier to query and analyze the data.
The command requires some parameters:
tournament: A unique name for the tournament of the log files, for example 'RoboCup2019'
division: The division of the log files, one of: 'DivA', 'DivB', 'none'
sqlDbSource: A connection string to the target database
ssl-match-stats-db \
 -parallel=16 \
 -sqlDbSource=
"
postgres://ssl_match_stats:ssl_match_stats@localhost:5432/ssl_match_stats?sslmode=disable
"
 \
 -tournament=Test \
 -division=DivA \
 stats/
*
.bin
Local Setup
Use the provided compose setup to run the database and metabase locally.
docker compose up -d
The database connection string
is: 
postgres://ssl_match_stats:ssl_match_stats@localhost:5432/ssl_match_stats?sslmode=disable
Remote Setup
The host the statistics one a server, following the below instructions.
See 
Setup for Match Stats DB
 for instructions on setting up the PostgreSQL database.
See 
Setup for Metabase
 for instructions on setting up Metabase, an open-source BI
software.

ssl-match-stats
A tool that generates statistics from 
official SSL log files
.
Requirements
You need to install following dependencies:
Go
Usage
Build
#
 Build the binaries and install them in $GOPATH/bin
make install
Generate Statistics
The 
ssl-match-stats
 command will generate the statistics into an intermediate data structure 
*.{json|bin}
from which they can be exported. This must be done per tournament and division.
The command takes a list of log files as input:
mkdir -p stats
ssl-match-stats -parallel 16 -targetDir stats *.log.gz
Import Statistics into a Database
The generated statistics can be exported into a PostgreSQL database.
This makes it easier to query and analyze the data.
The command requires some parameters:
tournament: A unique name for the tournament of the log files, for example 'RoboCup2019'
division: The division of the log files, one of: 'DivA', 'DivB', 'none'
sqlDbSource: A connection string to the target database
ssl-match-stats-db \
 -parallel=16 \
 -sqlDbSource=
"
postgres://ssl_match_stats:ssl_match_stats@localhost:5432/ssl_match_stats?sslmode=disable
"
 \
 -tournament=Test \
 -division=DivA \
 stats/
*
.bin
Local Setup
Use the provided compose setup to run the database and metabase locally.
docker compose up -d
The database connection string
is: 
postgres://ssl_match_stats:ssl_match_stats@localhost:5432/ssl_match_stats?sslmode=disable
Remote Setup
The host the statistics one a server, following the below instructions.
See 
Setup for Match Stats DB
 for instructions on setting up the PostgreSQL database.
See 
Setup for Metabase
 for instructions on setting up Metabase, an open-source BI
software.
Manual data correction
If you want to evaluate the start time offset between scheduled match start time and actual start time,
you need to add the scheduled time into 
matches.start_time_planned
 manually.
Protobuf
To generate the sources from the 
.proto
 files, run 
make proto
.
Implementation Details
This tool reads log files one by one with the 
ssl-match-stats
 command and creates a protobuf file based
on 
ssl_match_stats.proto
.
This structure contains a 
MatchStats
 object per match (log file), which contains:
Some meta data like name, duration, etc.
A list of all game phases (which map roughly to referee commands)
TeamStats
 for each team
The incentive is that the 
MatchStats
 structure contains an improved representation of the referee messages
for further processing. The match is split into game phases, where a new game phase is started for each new command
(except the goal commands). Each game phase has metadata, entry and exit states and game events attached to it.
TeamStats
 contain aggregated final counters and timers.
With this improved representation, the data can be exported for further analysis.

ssl-match-stats
A tool that generates statistics from 
official SSL log files
.
Requirements
You need to install following dependencies:
Go
Usage
Build
#
 Build the binaries and install them in $GOPATH/bin
make install
Generate Statistics
The 
ssl-match-stats
 command will generate the statistics into an intermediate data structure 
*.{json|bin}
from which they can be exported. This must be done per tournament and division.
The command takes a list of log files as input:
mkdir -p stats
ssl-match-stats -parallel 16 -targetDir stats *.log.gz
Import Statistics into a Database
The generated statistics can be exported into a PostgreSQL database.
This makes it easier to query and analyze the data.
The command requires some parameters:
tournament: A unique name for the tournament of the log files, for example 'RoboCup2019'
division: The division of the log files, one of: 'DivA', 'DivB', 'none'
sqlDbSource: A connection string to the target database
ssl-match-stats-db \
 -parallel=16 \
 -sqlDbSource=
"
postgres://ssl_match_stats:ssl_match_stats@localhost:5432/ssl_match_stats?sslmode=disable
"
 \
 -tournament=Test \
 -division=DivA \
 stats/
*
.bin
Local Setup
Use the provided compose setup to run the database and metabase locally.
docker compose up -d
The database connection string
is: 
postgres://ssl_match_stats:ssl_match_stats@localhost:5432/ssl_match_stats?sslmode=disable
Remote Setup
The host the statistics one a server, following the below instructions.
See 
Setup for Match Stats DB
 for instructions on setting up the PostgreSQL database.
See 
Setup for Metabase
 for instructions on setting up Metabase, an open-source BI
software.
Manual data correction
If you want to evaluate the start time offset between scheduled match start time and actual start time,
you need to add the scheduled time into 
matches.start_time_planned
 manually.
Protobuf
To generate the sources from the 
.proto
 files, run 
make proto
.
Implementation Details
This tool reads log files one by one with the 
ssl-match-stats
 command and creates a protobuf file based
on 
ssl_match_stats.proto
.
This structure contains a 
MatchStats
 object per match (log file), which contains:
Some meta data like name, duration, etc.
A list of all game phases (which map roughly to referee commands)
TeamStats
 for each team
The incentive is that the 
MatchStats
 structure contains an improved representation of the referee messages
for further processing. The match is split into game phases, where a new game phase is started for each new command
(except the goal commands). Each game phase has metadata, entry and exit states and game events attached to it.
TeamStats
 contain aggregated final counters and timers.
With this improved representation, the data can be exported for further analysis.

Go
Usage
Build
#
 Build the binaries and install them in $GOPATH/bin
make install
Generate Statistics
The 
ssl-match-stats
 command will generate the statistics into an intermediate data structure 
*.{json|bin}
from which they can be exported. This must be done per tournament and division.
The command takes a list of log files as input:
mkdir -p stats
ssl-match-stats -parallel 16 -targetDir stats *.log.gz
Import Statistics into a Database
The generated statistics can be exported into a PostgreSQL database.
This makes it easier to query and analyze the data.
The command requires some parameters:
tournament: A unique name for the tournament of the log files, for example 'RoboCup2019'
division: The division of the log files, one of: 'DivA', 'DivB', 'none'
sqlDbSource: A connection string to the target database
ssl-match-stats-db \
 -parallel=16 \
 -sqlDbSource=
"
postgres://ssl_match_stats:ssl_match_stats@localhost:5432/ssl_match_stats?sslmode=disable
"
 \
 -tournament=Test \
 -division=DivA \
 stats/
*
.bin
Local Setup
Use the provided compose setup to run the database and metabase locally.
docker compose up -d
The database connection string
is: 
postgres://ssl_match_stats:ssl_match_stats@localhost:5432/ssl_match_stats?sslmode=disable
Remote Setup
The host the statistics one a server, following the below instructions.
See 
Setup for Match Stats DB
 for instructions on setting up the PostgreSQL database.
See 
Setup for Metabase
 for instructions on setting up Metabase, an open-source BI
software.
Manual data correction
If you want to evaluate the start time offset between scheduled match start time and actual start time,
you need to add the scheduled time into 
matches.start_time_planned
 manually.
Protobuf
To generate the sources from the 
.proto
 files, run 
make proto
.
Implementation Details
This tool reads log files one by one with the 
ssl-match-stats
 command and creates a protobuf file based
on 
ssl_match_stats.proto
.
This structure contains a 
MatchStats
 object per match (log file), which contains:
Some meta data like name, duration, etc.
A list of all game phases (which map roughly to referee commands)
TeamStats
 for each team
The incentive is that the 
MatchStats
 structure contains an improved representation of the referee messages
for further processing. The match is split into game phases, where a new game phase is started for each new command
(except the goal commands). Each game phase has metadata, entry and exit states and game events attached to it.
TeamStats
 contain aggregated final counters and timers.
With this improved representation, the data can be exported for further analysis.

ssl-game-controller
The game controller for matches in the RoboCup Small Size league, introduced at RoboCup 2019 as a replacement of
the 
ssl-refbox
.
Add your team name
If you are a new team, please add your team name to 
internal/app/engine/config.go
.
Usage
If you just want to use this app, simply download the
latest 
release binary
. The binary is
self-contained. No dependencies are required.
You can also use pre-build docker images:
docker pull robocupssl/ssl-game-controller
#
 Run GC with default configuration
docker run -p 8081:8081 robocupssl/ssl-game-controller -address :8081
#
 Mount local directories
docker run -p 8081:8081 \
#
 Local config dir
-v 
"
$(
pwd
)
"
/config:/config \
#
 Local data dir (current state)
-v 
"
$(
pwd
)
"
/data:/data \
 robocupssl/ssl-game-controller
The controller will generate a default config to 
config/
 on the first start. Afterwards, you can change all
settings there.
For example, if you want to add a new team name temporarily, you can add it
to 
config/engine.yaml
. If you want to add your team persistently, add it to 
defaultTeams
in 
internal/app/engine/config.go
 and create a pull request on GitHub.
Runtime Requirements
No software dependencies (except for development, see below)
pre-build binaries: 64bit Linux, Windows, OSX
A reasonable Web-Browser (mostly tested on Chrome)
External Runtime Dependencies
ssl-vision
 - Receive Geometry packages for correct field dimensions.
If not available, make sure to configure the correct dimensions
in 
config/ssl-game-controller.yaml
.
tracker-source implementation that produces
TrackerWrapperPacket
 -
Get ball and robot positions.
Required for:
Check ball placement progress
Check for correct number of robots per team
Check if game can continue (ball and robots prepared)
Check for "no progress"
Check if keeper may be changed via team protocol
The 
TIGERs AutoRef
 and
the 
ER-Force AutoRef
 are tracker-source implementations.
If no tracker-source is available, the above features will not work.
Reference Clients
There are some reference clients:
ssl-ref-client
: A client that receives referee messages
ssl-auto-ref-client
: A client that connects to the controller as an autoRef
ssl-team-client
: A client that connects to the controller as a team
ssl-remote-control-client
: A client that connects to the controller as a remote-control
ssl-ci-test-client
: A client that connects to the CI interface of the controller
Integration into your own framework
The game-controller is designed to be integrated into your own AI framework, if you do not want to implement your own controller for testing purposes.
Download the release binary from the Github release and run it from inside your framework.
You can adapt the 
ssl-game-controller.yaml
 config file that is generated on first startup,
like changing the default ports. Some parameters can also be passed via command line.
Find the available parameters with the 
-h
 option.
Make sure to use non-standard ports whenever possible to avoid any interference with a real field setup.
There are three modes that you can run the ssl-game-controller with:
system
 (default): Use system time
vision
: Receive messages from ssl-vision and use the timestamps from these messages as the time source. This is mostly useful, when you produce your own ssl-vision frames from simulation.
ci
: Connect your software directly to the GC via TCP. You send the current timestamp and tracker packets and will receive the resulting referee message.
It is highly recommended using the 
ci
 mode when you integrate the GC with your own simulator.
It has the following advantages:
No multicast network traffic is required that might be published to your local network (make sure to unset 
network.publish-address
)
You have full control of the data flow. The GC will not do anything asynchronously in the background
You define the time and thus the speed.
You provide the ssl-vision tracking data directly.
If you use external simulators like grSim, you can consider using the 
vision
 mode instead.
That way, the game-controller uses the time and speed of the simulator, even if it is not
running in real time. You then still need to run a tracking-source implementation like an AutoRef
if you require the additional features described in [External Runtime Dependencies](#External Runtime Dependencies).
When you enable 
ci
 mode, referee messages will still be published via multicast,
unless the address is unset (set to an empty string). That way, you can still integrate
an autoRef or other software. Have a look at 
Auto-referee CI
 for details on how to integrate the auto-referees in a CI way as well.
When the 
ci
 mode is enabled (via 
ssl-game-controller.yaml
 -> 
time-acquisition-mode
),
a TCP port is opened (default: 10009). The protocol is defined in 
proto/ssl_gc_ci.proto
.
You send 
CiInput
 messages and receive 
CiOutput
 messages. The protocol is the same as for the 
team-client
.
Each input will produce one or more outputs.
This is, because some changes will generate multiple messages.
CiOutput
 messages will also be pushed to the CI client for manual changes from the UI or UI API.
The GC requires some input data, see [External Runtime Dependencies](#External Runtime Dependencies).
In the 
ci
 mode, you have to provide the geometry statically in 
config/ssl-game-controller.yaml
 or send it through 
CiInput
.
The ball and robot positions must be sent with the 
CiInput
.
It is sufficient to fill in the required fields and keep the optional empty.
A small sample test client for the 
ci
 mode can be found here: 
ssl-ci-test-client
If you can not use the 
ci
 mode, you can alternatively connect to the GC using the UI WebSocket API.
The API is defined in 
proto/ssl_gc_api.proto
 and available at the path 
/api/control
under the same port as the UI.
Examples
Integration of the binary: 
https://github.com/TIGERs-Mannheim/AutoReferee/blob/master/modules/moduli-referee/src/main/java/edu/tigers/sumatra/referee/SslGameControllerProcess.java
WebSocket API in Java: 
https://github.com/TIGERs-Mannheim/AutoReferee/blob/master/modules/moduli-referee/src/main/java/edu/tigers/sumatra/referee/control
Development
Requirements
You need to install following dependencies first:
Go
Node
See 
.circleci/config.yml
 for compatible versions.
Frontend
See 
frontend/README.md
Build
Build and install all binaries:
make install
Run
go run cmd/ssl-game-controller/main.go
Test with autoRefs
To quickly run the GC together with autoRefs and other popular components, run:
docker compose up
Update generated protobuf code
Generate the code for the 
.proto
 files after you've changed anything in a 
.proto
 file with:
make proto

Crunching the latest data, just for you. Hang tight…
We don’t have enough data to show anything useful.
It usually takes about a week to populate this graph.
There are too many commits to generate this graph.
More information about this data can be found in the
activity documentation
.
We need at least one non-empty commit with an email to generate this graph.
We tried our best, but the graph wouldn’t load. Try reloading the page.

ssl-game-controller
The game controller for matches in the RoboCup Small Size league, introduced at RoboCup 2019 as a replacement of
the 
ssl-refbox
.
Add your team name
If you are a new team, please add your team name to 
internal/app/engine/config.go
.
Usage
If you just want to use this app, simply download the
latest 
release binary
. The binary is
self-contained. No dependencies are required.
You can also use pre-build docker images:
docker pull robocupssl/ssl-game-controller
#
 Run GC with default configuration
docker run -p 8081:8081 robocupssl/ssl-game-controller -address :8081
#
 Mount local directories
docker run -p 8081:8081 \
#
 Local config dir
-v 
"
$(
pwd
)
"
/config:/config \
#
 Local data dir (current state)
-v 
"
$(
pwd
)
"
/data:/data \
 robocupssl/ssl-game-controller
The controller will generate a default config to 
config/
 on the first start. Afterwards, you can change all
settings there.
For example, if you want to add a new team name temporarily, you can add it
to 
config/engine.yaml
. If you want to add your team persistently, add it to 
defaultTeams
in 
internal/app/engine/config.go
 and create a pull request on GitHub.
Runtime Requirements
No software dependencies (except for development, see below)
pre-build binaries: 64bit Linux, Windows, OSX
A reasonable Web-Browser (mostly tested on Chrome)
External Runtime Dependencies
ssl-vision
 - Receive Geometry packages for correct field dimensions.
If not available, make sure to configure the correct dimensions
in 
config/ssl-game-controller.yaml
.
tracker-source implementation that produces
TrackerWrapperPacket
 -
Get ball and robot positions.
Required for:
Check ball placement progress
Check for correct number of robots per team
Check if game can continue (ball and robots prepared)
Check for "no progress"
Check if keeper may be changed via team protocol
The 
TIGERs AutoRef
 and
the 
ER-Force AutoRef
 are tracker-source implementations.
If no tracker-source is available, the above features will not work.
Reference Clients
There are some reference clients:
ssl-ref-client
: A client that receives referee messages
ssl-auto-ref-client
: A client that connects to the controller as an autoRef
ssl-team-client
: A client that connects to the controller as a team
ssl-remote-control-client
: A client that connects to the controller as a remote-control
ssl-ci-test-client
: A client that connects to the CI interface of the controller
Integration into your own framework
The game-controller is designed to be integrated into your own AI framework, if you do not want to implement your own controller for testing purposes.
Download the release binary from the Github release and run it from inside your framework.
You can adapt the 
ssl-game-controller.yaml
 config file that is generated on first startup,
like changing the default ports. Some parameters can also be passed via command line.
Find the available parameters with the 
-h
 option.
Make sure to use non-standard ports whenever possible to avoid any interference with a real field setup.
There are three modes that you can run the ssl-game-controller with:
system
 (default): Use system time
vision
: Receive messages from ssl-vision and use the timestamps from these messages as the time source. This is mostly useful, when you produce your own ssl-vision frames from simulation.
ci
: Connect your software directly to the GC via TCP. You send the current timestamp and tracker packets and will receive the resulting referee message.
It is highly recommended using the 
ci
 mode when you integrate the GC with your own simulator.
It has the following advantages:
No multicast network traffic is required that might be published to your local network (make sure to unset 
network.publish-address
)
You have full control of the data flow. The GC will not do anything asynchronously in the background
You define the time and thus the speed.
You provide the ssl-vision tracking data directly.
If you use external simulators like grSim, you can consider using the 
vision
 mode instead.
That way, the game-controller uses the time and speed of the simulator, even if it is not
running in real time. You then still need to run a tracking-source implementation like an AutoRef
if you require the additional features described in [External Runtime Dependencies](#External Runtime Dependencies).
When you enable 
ci
 mode, referee messages will still be published via multicast,
unless the address is unset (set to an empty string). That way, you can still integrate
an autoRef or other software. Have a look at 
Auto-referee CI
 for details on how to integrate the auto-referees in a CI way as well.
When the 
ci
 mode is enabled (via 
ssl-game-controller.yaml
 -> 
time-acquisition-mode
),
a TCP port is opened (default: 10009). The protocol is defined in 
proto/ssl_gc_ci.proto
.
You send 
CiInput
 messages and receive 
CiOutput
 messages. The protocol is the same as for the 
team-client
.
Each input will produce one or more outputs.
This is, because some changes will generate multiple messages.
CiOutput
 messages will also be pushed to the CI client for manual changes from the UI or UI API.
The GC requires some input data, see [External Runtime Dependencies](#External Runtime Dependencies).
In the 
ci
 mode, you have to provide the geometry statically in 
config/ssl-game-controller.yaml
 or send it through 
CiInput
.
The ball and robot positions must be sent with the 
CiInput
.
It is sufficient to fill in the required fields and keep the optional empty.
A small sample test client for the 
ci
 mode can be found here: 
ssl-ci-test-client
If you can not use the 
ci
 mode, you can alternatively connect to the GC using the UI WebSocket API.
The API is defined in 
proto/ssl_gc_api.proto
 and available at the path 
/api/control
under the same port as the UI.
Examples

ssl-game-controller
The game controller for matches in the RoboCup Small Size league, introduced at RoboCup 2019 as a replacement of
the 
ssl-refbox
.
Add your team name
If you are a new team, please add your team name to 
internal/app/engine/config.go
.
Usage
If you just want to use this app, simply download the
latest 
release binary
. The binary is
self-contained. No dependencies are required.
You can also use pre-build docker images:
docker pull robocupssl/ssl-game-controller
#
 Run GC with default configuration
docker run -p 8081:8081 robocupssl/ssl-game-controller -address :8081
#
 Mount local directories
docker run -p 8081:8081 \
#
 Local config dir
-v 
"
$(
pwd
)
"
/config:/config \
#
 Local data dir (current state)
-v 
"
$(
pwd
)
"
/data:/data \
 robocupssl/ssl-game-controller
The controller will generate a default config to 
config/
 on the first start. Afterwards, you can change all
settings there.
For example, if you want to add a new team name temporarily, you can add it
to 
config/engine.yaml
. If you want to add your team persistently, add it to 
defaultTeams
in 
internal/app/engine/config.go
 and create a pull request on GitHub.
Runtime Requirements
No software dependencies (except for development, see below)
pre-build binaries: 64bit Linux, Windows, OSX
A reasonable Web-Browser (mostly tested on Chrome)
External Runtime Dependencies
ssl-vision
 - Receive Geometry packages for correct field dimensions.
If not available, make sure to configure the correct dimensions
in 
config/ssl-game-controller.yaml
.
tracker-source implementation that produces
TrackerWrapperPacket
 -
Get ball and robot positions.
Required for:
Check ball placement progress
Check for correct number of robots per team
Check if game can continue (ball and robots prepared)
Check for "no progress"
Check if keeper may be changed via team protocol
The 
TIGERs AutoRef
 and
the 
ER-Force AutoRef
 are tracker-source implementations.
If no tracker-source is available, the above features will not work.
Reference Clients
There are some reference clients:
ssl-ref-client
: A client that receives referee messages
ssl-auto-ref-client
: A client that connects to the controller as an autoRef
ssl-team-client
: A client that connects to the controller as a team
ssl-remote-control-client
: A client that connects to the controller as a remote-control
ssl-ci-test-client
: A client that connects to the CI interface of the controller
Integration into your own framework
The game-controller is designed to be integrated into your own AI framework, if you do not want to implement your own controller for testing purposes.
Download the release binary from the Github release and run it from inside your framework.
You can adapt the 
ssl-game-controller.yaml
 config file that is generated on first startup,
like changing the default ports. Some parameters can also be passed via command line.
Find the available parameters with the 
-h
 option.
Make sure to use non-standard ports whenever possible to avoid any interference with a real field setup.
There are three modes that you can run the ssl-game-controller with:
system
 (default): Use system time
vision
: Receive messages from ssl-vision and use the timestamps from these messages as the time source. This is mostly useful, when you produce your own ssl-vision frames from simulation.
ci
: Connect your software directly to the GC via TCP. You send the current timestamp and tracker packets and will receive the resulting referee message.
It is highly recommended using the 
ci
 mode when you integrate the GC with your own simulator.
It has the following advantages:
No multicast network traffic is required that might be published to your local network (make sure to unset 
network.publish-address
)
You have full control of the data flow. The GC will not do anything asynchronously in the background
You define the time and thus the speed.
You provide the ssl-vision tracking data directly.
If you use external simulators like grSim, you can consider using the 
vision
 mode instead.
That way, the game-controller uses the time and speed of the simulator, even if it is not
running in real time. You then still need to run a tracking-source implementation like an AutoRef
if you require the additional features described in [External Runtime Dependencies](#External Runtime Dependencies).
When you enable 
ci
 mode, referee messages will still be published via multicast,
unless the address is unset (set to an empty string). That way, you can still integrate
an autoRef or other software. Have a look at 
Auto-referee CI
 for details on how to integrate the auto-referees in a CI way as well.
When the 
ci
 mode is enabled (via 
ssl-game-controller.yaml
 -> 
time-acquisition-mode
),
a TCP port is opened (default: 10009). The protocol is defined in 
proto/ssl_gc_ci.proto
.
You send 
CiInput
 messages and receive 
CiOutput
 messages. The protocol is the same as for the 
team-client
.
Each input will produce one or more outputs.
This is, because some changes will generate multiple messages.
CiOutput
 messages will also be pushed to the CI client for manual changes from the UI or UI API.
The GC requires some input data, see [External Runtime Dependencies](#External Runtime Dependencies).
In the 
ci
 mode, you have to provide the geometry statically in 
config/ssl-game-controller.yaml
 or send it through 
CiInput
.
The ball and robot positions must be sent with the 
CiInput
.
It is sufficient to fill in the required fields and keep the optional empty.
A small sample test client for the 
ci
 mode can be found here: 
ssl-ci-test-client
If you can not use the 
ci
 mode, you can alternatively connect to the GC using the UI WebSocket API.
The API is defined in 
proto/ssl_gc_api.proto
 and available at the path 
/api/control
under the same port as the UI.
Examples
Integration of the binary: 
https://github.com/TIGERs-Mannheim/AutoReferee/blob/master/modules/moduli-referee/src/main/java/edu/tigers/sumatra/referee/SslGameControllerProcess.java
WebSocket API in Java: 
https://github.com/TIGERs-Mannheim/AutoReferee/blob/master/modules/moduli-referee/src/main/java/edu/tigers/sumatra/referee/control
Development
Requirements
You need to install following dependencies first:
Go
Node
See 
.circleci/config.yml
 for compatible versions.
Frontend
See 
frontend/README.md
Build
Build and install all binaries:
make install
Run
go run cmd/ssl-game-controller/main.go
Test with autoRefs
To quickly run the GC together with autoRefs and other popular components, run:
docker compose up
Update generated protobuf code
Generate the code for the 
.proto
 files after you've changed anything in a 
.proto
 file with:
make proto

ssl-game-controller
The game controller for matches in the RoboCup Small Size league, introduced at RoboCup 2019 as a replacement of
the 
ssl-refbox
.
Add your team name
If you are a new team, please add your team name to 
internal/app/engine/config.go
.
Usage
If you just want to use this app, simply download the
latest 
release binary
. The binary is
self-contained. No dependencies are required.
You can also use pre-build docker images:
docker pull robocupssl/ssl-game-controller
#
 Run GC with default configuration
docker run -p 8081:8081 robocupssl/ssl-game-controller -address :8081
#
 Mount local directories
docker run -p 8081:8081 \
#
 Local config dir
-v 
"
$(
pwd
)
"
/config:/config \
#
 Local data dir (current state)
-v 
"
$(
pwd
)
"
/data:/data \
 robocupssl/ssl-game-controller
The controller will generate a default config to 
config/
 on the first start. Afterwards, you can change all
settings there.
For example, if you want to add a new team name temporarily, you can add it
to 
config/engine.yaml
. If you want to add your team persistently, add it to 
defaultTeams
in 
internal/app/engine/config.go
 and create a pull request on GitHub.
Runtime Requirements
No software dependencies (except for development, see below)
pre-build binaries: 64bit Linux, Windows, OSX
A reasonable Web-Browser (mostly tested on Chrome)
External Runtime Dependencies
ssl-vision
 - Receive Geometry packages for correct field dimensions.
If not available, make sure to configure the correct dimensions
in 
config/ssl-game-controller.yaml
.
tracker-source implementation that produces
TrackerWrapperPacket
 -
Get ball and robot positions.
Required for:
Check ball placement progress
Check for correct number of robots per team
Check if game can continue (ball and robots prepared)
Check for "no progress"
Check if keeper may be changed via team protocol
The 
TIGERs AutoRef
 and
the 
ER-Force AutoRef
 are tracker-source implementations.
If no tracker-source is available, the above features will not work.
Reference Clients
There are some reference clients:
ssl-ref-client
: A client that receives referee messages
ssl-auto-ref-client
: A client that connects to the controller as an autoRef
ssl-team-client
: A client that connects to the controller as a team
ssl-remote-control-client
: A client that connects to the controller as a remote-control
ssl-ci-test-client
: A client that connects to the CI interface of the controller
Integration into your own framework
The game-controller is designed to be integrated into your own AI framework, if you do not want to implement your own controller for testing purposes.
Download the release binary from the Github release and run it from inside your framework.
You can adapt the 
ssl-game-controller.yaml
 config file that is generated on first startup,
like changing the default ports. Some parameters can also be passed via command line.
Find the available parameters with the 
-h
 option.
Make sure to use non-standard ports whenever possible to avoid any interference with a real field setup.
There are three modes that you can run the ssl-game-controller with:
system
 (default): Use system time
vision
: Receive messages from ssl-vision and use the timestamps from these messages as the time source. This is mostly useful, when you produce your own ssl-vision frames from simulation.
ci
: Connect your software directly to the GC via TCP. You send the current timestamp and tracker packets and will receive the resulting referee message.
It is highly recommended using the 
ci
 mode when you integrate the GC with your own simulator.
It has the following advantages:
No multicast network traffic is required that might be published to your local network (make sure to unset 
network.publish-address
)
You have full control of the data flow. The GC will not do anything asynchronously in the background
You define the time and thus the speed.
You provide the ssl-vision tracking data directly.
If you use external simulators like grSim, you can consider using the 
vision
 mode instead.
That way, the game-controller uses the time and speed of the simulator, even if it is not
running in real time. You then still need to run a tracking-source implementation like an AutoRef
if you require the additional features described in [External Runtime Dependencies](#External Runtime Dependencies).
When you enable 
ci
 mode, referee messages will still be published via multicast,
unless the address is unset (set to an empty string). That way, you can still integrate
an autoRef or other software. Have a look at 
Auto-referee CI
 for details on how to integrate the auto-referees in a CI way as well.
When the 
ci
 mode is enabled (via 
ssl-game-controller.yaml
 -> 
time-acquisition-mode
),
a TCP port is opened (default: 10009). The protocol is defined in 
proto/ssl_gc_ci.proto
.
You send 
CiInput
 messages and receive 
CiOutput
 messages. The protocol is the same as for the 
team-client
.
Each input will produce one or more outputs.
This is, because some changes will generate multiple messages.
CiOutput
 messages will also be pushed to the CI client for manual changes from the UI or UI API.
The GC requires some input data, see [External Runtime Dependencies](#External Runtime Dependencies).
In the 
ci
 mode, you have to provide the geometry statically in 
config/ssl-game-controller.yaml
 or send it through 
CiInput
.
The ball and robot positions must be sent with the 
CiInput
.
It is sufficient to fill in the required fields and keep the optional empty.
A small sample test client for the 
ci
 mode can be found here: 
ssl-ci-test-client
If you can not use the 
ci
 mode, you can alternatively connect to the GC using the UI WebSocket API.
The API is defined in 
proto/ssl_gc_api.proto
 and available at the path 
/api/control
under the same port as the UI.
Examples
Integration of the binary: 
https://github.com/TIGERs-Mannheim/AutoReferee/blob/master/modules/moduli-referee/src/main/java/edu/tigers/sumatra/referee/SslGameControllerProcess.java
WebSocket API in Java: 
https://github.com/TIGERs-Mannheim/AutoReferee/blob/master/modules/moduli-referee/src/main/java/edu/tigers/sumatra/referee/control
Development
Requirements
You need to install following dependencies first:
Go
Node
See 
.circleci/config.yml
 for compatible versions.
Frontend
See 
frontend/README.md
Build
Build and install all binaries:
make install
Run
go run cmd/ssl-game-controller/main.go
Test with autoRefs
To quickly run the GC together with autoRefs and other popular components, run:
docker compose up
Update generated protobuf code
Generate the code for the 
.proto
 files after you've changed anything in a 
.proto
 file with:
make proto

Automate your workflow from idea to production
GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub.
Learn more about getting started with Actions.
Linux, macOS, Windows, ARM, and containers
Hosted runners for every major OS make it easy to build and test all your projects. Run directly on a VM or inside a container. Use your own VMs, in the cloud or on-prem, with self-hosted runners.
Matrix builds
Save time with matrix workflows that simultaneously test across multiple operating systems and versions of your runtime.
Any language
GitHub Actions supports Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, Go, Rust, .NET, and more. Build, test, and deploy applications in your language of choice.
Live logs
See your workflow run in realtime with color and emoji. It’s one click to copy a link that highlights a specific line number to share a CI/CD failure.
Built-in secret store
Automate your software development practices with workflow files embracing the Git flow by codifying it in your repository.
Multi-container testing
Test your web service and its DB in your workflow by simply adding some 
docker-compose
 to your workflow file.

This comparison is taking too long to generate.
Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.
You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine: 
git diff v1.8.3...v2.0.0

This comparison is taking too long to generate.
Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.
You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine: 
git diff v1.6.0...v1.7.0

This comparison is taking too long to generate.
Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.
You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine: 
git diff v1.8.1...v1.8.2

This comparison is taking too long to generate.
Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.
You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine: 
git diff v1.7.0...v1.8.0

This comparison is taking too long to generate.
Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.
You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

Automate your workflow from idea to production
GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub.
Learn more about getting started with Actions.
Linux, macOS, Windows, ARM, and containers
Hosted runners for every major OS make it easy to build and test all your projects. Run directly on a VM or inside a container. Use your own VMs, in the cloud or on-prem, with self-hosted runners.
Matrix builds
Save time with matrix workflows that simultaneously test across multiple operating systems and versions of your runtime.
Any language
GitHub Actions supports Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, Go, Rust, .NET, and more. Build, test, and deploy applications in your language of choice.
Live logs
See your workflow run in realtime with color and emoji. It’s one click to copy a link that highlights a specific line number to share a CI/CD failure.
Built-in secret store
Automate your software development practices with workflow files embracing the Git flow by codifying it in your repository.
Multi-container testing
Test your web service and its DB in your workflow by simply adding some 
docker-compose
 to your workflow file.

This comparison is taking too long to generate.
Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.
You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine: 
git diff v1.4.1...v1.4.2

Crunching the latest data, just for you. Hang tight…
We don’t have enough data to show anything useful.
It usually takes about a week to populate this graph.
There are too many commits to generate this graph.
More information about this data can be found in the
activity documentation
.
We need at least one non-empty commit with an email to generate this graph.
We tried our best, but the graph wouldn’t load. Try reloading the page.

RoboCup Small Size League Shared Vision System
In the past, RoboCup Small Size League rules allowed every team to set up their own global vision system as a primary sensor.
This option beared several organizational limitations and costs for the teams, thus impairing the league's progress.
Additionally, most teams had converged on similar solutions and produced few significant research results to this global vision problem over the last years.
In 2009, the league committees decided to migrate to a shared vision system (including hardware) that could be used by all teams.
This system - named SSL-Vision - is currently developed by volunteers from participating teams.
To find more in-depth and up-to-date information about SSL-Vision (including installation and configuration),
please visit the 
Wiki Documentation Page
.
Software Requirements
Following dependencies are required to build the software:
g++
QT >= 4.3 with opengl and networking support
cmake
Eigen3
Google protocol buffers (protoc)
OpenGL
GLU
libjpeg
libpng
OpenCV >= 3
libdc1394 Version >= 2.0
video for linux 2 (v4l)
To get all of these packages in (k)ubuntu, run the 
InstallPackagesUbuntu.sh
 script.
Or, in archlinux, run the 
InstallPackagesArch.sh
 script.
Test data
If you do not have a camera available and want to test or improve ssl-vision, you can use the 
CaptureFromFile
 capture module to play back images.
To install some test data, run: 
make install_test_data
. It will download several test images to 
test-data
.
The default configuration of ssl-vision will peak this up automatically.
Supported cameras
Multiple cameras are supported:
1394B / Firewire 800 (backward compatible with 1394A)
Basic usb camera support via the 
Video for Linux (V4L)
 drivers
Matrix-Vision BlueFox (USB 2.0) and BlueFox3 (USB 3.0) cameras via 
mvIMPACT Acquire SDK
Basler cameras via the 
Pylon Software Suite
 (currently supports 7.2.1)
FLIR cameras via the 
SPINNAKER and FLYCAP SDK
To enable support for one or more of those cameras, install the corresponding SDK (linked above and described in more details below) first.
Then build with the corresponding option:
-DUSE_DC1394=true
-DUSE_SPINNAKER=true
-DUSE_mvIMPACT=true
-DUSE_PYLON=true
-DUSE_FLYCAP=true
-DUSE_V4L=true
Example for a release build: 
cmake -B build -DUSE_SPINNAKER=true
.
As these are cached cmake options, you only need to run this once and can build with 
make
 afterwards.
Virtual Splitter cameras
In addition to the physical cameras, you can activate virtual cameras with 
-DUSE_SPLITTER=true
.
There will be an additional 'Distributor Thread' that captures from a single physical camera (or from file).
The capture mode of the normal camera threads can be set to 'splitter'. That way, a part of the original image from the
distributor thread is used as input.
This may speedup processing time for cameras with large resolutions, but at the trait-of of multiple cameras with the
same camera center, which may not work well with some consumers.
Matrix-Vision cameras
USB 2.0 
BlueFox MLC
 and
USB 3.0 
BlueFox3-2
 cameras are supported.
Please note, that they require different SDKs. The SDK look very similar, but are not compatible. They get installed into the same directory by default.
Tested cameras:
mvBlueFOX-MLC200wC
mvBlueFOX3-2089
The SDK can be downloaded from the 
driver page
. Go to Linux => mvBlueFOX (USB2.0) or mvBlueFOX3 (USB3.0).
Download the 
install_mvBlueFOX.sh
 script and the correct 
.tgz
 file for your machine.
Open a terminal and navigate to your download folder. For a quick installation run:
sh install_mvBlueFOX.sh -u
Basler cameras
Basler cameras are supported via the 
Pylon Software Suite
.
This link
 should directly download the current supported version, 7.2.1.
Installation instructions are contained in the download.
Tested with 
Basler ace acA1300-75gc
.
FLIR cameras
USB 3.0 cameras are currently supported.
Tested cameras:
Blackfly S (BFS-U3-51S5C-C) - 
Documentation
Download and install the 
SDK
 and build ssl-vision with 
-DUSE_SPINNAKER=true
.
Compilation
Build the code by running:
make
If you need to pass extra parameters to cmake, you need to run 
cmake
 directly:
cmake -B build -DUSE_WHAT_SO_EVER=true
make
The 
USE_*
 parameters are cached, so they do not have to be passed in each time.
Running
Depending on your OS, you might need to ensure that you have full access to the firewire devices /dev/fw*.
This 
might
 require logging in as root or adding your user to a certain group.
Run the software using the following command:
./bin/vision
You can automatically start capturing with the 
-s
 option.
If all 
.
 turn into 
,
 in robocup-ssl-teams.xml, you can change this by running
export
 LC_NUMERIC=en_US.UTF-8
before running 
vision
. This is not required, though.
Starting to Capture and Setting Parameters
Once the software is running, you should see some empty capture frames
on the right, and a data-tree structure on the left. In this
data-structure you can setup your camera parameters,
such as resolution, capture mode, etc.
A quick hint: The text-field below the data-tree allows for
fast search through the data-tree.
See the section of DC1394 parameters below to get an idea of what the
parameters do.
Once you have them set up, you can start capturing by clicking
"Image Capture/Capture Control/Start"
 in the data-tree.
DC1394 Parameters
If you expand the tree then the capture parameters are in
"Image Capture/DC1394/Capture Settings"
Furthermore, conversion settings are in
"Image Capture/DC1394/Conversion Settings"
"convert to mode" should currently be "yuv422"
for best performance, "capture mode" should also be "yuv422",
but can also be a different format such as "yuv411" or "rgb"
Alternatively, if you desire, you can do de-bayering in software,
but this will take extra CPU cycles. To do so, you would set the
capture mode to e.g. "raw8" and the convert mode to "rgb". Finally,
you will need to set "de-bayer" to true, and select the correct
de-bayer pattern and desired method.
Capturing supports both DCAM native modes and Format7 modes.
This is selected in the "capture format" field. Leaving it on
"auto" will attempt native mode first, then 
format7_0
.
By default, ISO800 support is disabled. To enable it, mark the
field "use ISO800" as true.
ONLINE PARAMETERS
Once you start capturing, you should see the realtime video image
on the right. Furthermore, in the data tree, you should be able to go to the
"Camera Parameters" node which will then be expandable and show
all of your DCAM parameters.
You can adjust all of these parameters in real-time.
Note that the read-out of these parameters from the camera
only happens automatically if "auto refresh params" in the
Capture Control is set to true. Otherwise, you can use
the "re-read params" "Refresh" button to refresh them manually.
For performance reasons, it might make sense to set auto refresh
to false, so the bus is not being flooded with too much control
data and has full bandwidth available for the video streaming.
Storage of Settings and Parameters
When you quit the application normally 
parameters will be
saved automatically
, but on a system crash, they won't.
Make sure to regularly save the settings manually by click on the 
Save Settings
button immediately under the main 
Vision System
 node.
All settings will be automatically restored during the next
program start.
In case the files should ever become corrupted, or the
program refuses to start completely when parsing the XML files
(this should normally never occur) then simply delete all
XML files and restart. The program will restore its default
settings.

Introduction
In the past, RoboCup Small Size League rules allowed every team to set up their own global vision system as a primary sensor. This option beared several organizational limitations and costs for the teams, thus impairing the league's progress. Additionally, most teams had converged on similar solutions and produced few significant research results to this global vision problem over the last years.
In 2009, the league committees decided to migrate to a shared vision system (including hardware) that could be used by all teams. This system - named SSL-Vision - is currently developed by volunteers from participating teams. This manual describes the current state and usage of SSL-Vision.
A paper describing SSL-Vision is available 
here
 (Bibtex file available 
here
).
Example Configuration
If you are new to ssl-vision and want to get used to it, you can start with a ready to use 
config
 with images from a real field. Note, that the field has the dimensions of the single sized field, but with four cameras (due to limited room height).
Standard Marker Colours
As of RoboCup 2015, teams were required to purchase their own colored paper for robot markers instead of receiving it at the competition. For RoboCup 2018, LOC will provide paper at the competition again. OC/TC/LOC will try to find good colors. Some of the standard colors from last years were not ideal.
The standard marker papers until RoboCup 2017 were:
Pink
Green
Blue
 (the light side)
Yellow

We don’t have enough data to show anything useful.
It usually takes about a week to populate this graph.
There are too many commits to generate this graph.
More information about this data can be found in the
activity documentation

We need at least one non-empty commit with an email to generate this graph.
We tried our best, but the graph wouldn’t load. Try reloading the page.

Automate your workflow from idea to production
GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub.
Learn more about getting started with Actions.
Linux, macOS, Windows, ARM, and containers
Hosted runners for every major OS make it easy to build and test all your projects. Run directly on a VM or inside a container. Use your own VMs, in the cloud or on-prem, with self-hosted runners.
Matrix builds
Save time with matrix workflows that simultaneously test across multiple operating systems and versions of your runtime.
Any language
GitHub Actions supports Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, Go, Rust, .NET, and more. Build, test, and deploy applications in your language of choice.
Live logs
See your workflow run in realtime with color and emoji. It’s one click to copy a link that highlights a specific line number to share a CI/CD failure.
Built-in secret store
Automate your software development practices with workflow files embracing the Git flow by codifying it in your repository.
Multi-container testing
Test your web service and its DB in your workflow by simply adding some 
docker-compose
 to your workflow file.
