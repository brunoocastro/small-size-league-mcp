CONTENT:
The league attempts to create log files of all official matches during each RoboCup. They contain the timestamped ProtoBuf messages of ssl-vision, ssl-game-controller and vision-tracker producers like the autoRefs.
Software
The league provides multiple tools to deal with log files of SSL games:

ssl-logtools (C++): Original tooling with recorder and player
ssl-go-tools (Go): Set of CLI tools to record, play and analyze log files

The ssl-logtools can be considered legacy and are not maintained anymore. However, the ssl-go-tools do not provide a UI for the player yet.
File Format
Each log file starts with the following header:

1: String – File type (“SSL_LOG_FILE”) 2: Int32 – Log file format version 

Format version 1 encodes the protobuf messages in the following format:

1: Int64 – Receiver timestamp in ns 2: Int32 – Message type 3: Int32 – Size of binary protobuf message 4: String – Binary protobuf message 

The message types are:

MESSAGE_BLANK = 0 (ignore message)MESSAGE_UNKNOWN = 1 (try to guess message type by parsing the data)MESSAGE_SSL_VISION_2010 = 2MESSAGE_SSL_REFBOX_2013 = 3MESSAGE_SSL_VISION_2014 = 4MESSAGE_SSL_VISION_TRACKER_2020 = 5MESSAGE_SSL_INDEX_2021 = 6

Files can optionally contain an index at the end of the file for random access to messages (for fast seeking for example). An indexed log file has a message of type MESSAGE_SSL_INDEX_2021 as the last message. The value of the timestamp is irrelevant. The message is not in protobuf format, but in simple binary format for easy relative access from the end of the file:

1: []Int64 – Array with byte-aligned offsets, starting at the beginning of the file2: Int64 – Offset from the end of the file to the beginning of the index message3: String – Index marker (“INDEXED”) to quickly check if a file is indexed

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions by February 1st, 2022:

Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).
Submit a Team Video.
Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2022 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

Team Name
Country
University
Main contact name and email
Website (if you have one)
Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be made via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The TDP should contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP should focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations should be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP should have a clear structure and it should be written in clear English.
The TDP should be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions.
The TDP should be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP should describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
We have to set up a conference management system to handle this year’s peer review process. It can be accessed at https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2022.
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existing account, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To create an account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. To submit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.
TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020 – This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardware improvements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also the reasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for other teams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier for reviewers to read it. It also has no overlaps with the team’s previous paper.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper – This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planning system. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significant changes in that area, and mentioning them would only mean having overlap with the previous paper. The size of the paper is also not excessively long.  
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020 – This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, the mechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It is a bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers each topic well and does not have overlap with the previous paper. 

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time. As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could be significantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. The qualification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old. Due to the COVID pandemic we allow to use a video from 2019, especially from participating in RoboCup Sydney, too. If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams to prove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If your video is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match, teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (see listing below).  The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. For participating in Division A, teams also have to show their ball placement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2022 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in a modern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

Technical Challenges of the Small Size League are intended to encourage teams to develop solutions to specific problems that will advance the quality of gameplay within the league. Teams are evaluated for their completion of the challenge during a designated time at RoboCup each year.
Rules
Below are the rules for the different RoboCup 2024 technical challenges. Source code associated with these challenges can be found on GitHub.
Black and White Hulls Challenge
Since many teams currently use black as their main hull color, making it difficult to distinguish between the two teams during the game, this challenge aims to find a way to quickly change the hull color from black to white and back.

Chip Kick Interception

The goal of this challenge is to detect and intercept chip kicks based on SSL Vision data.

Procedure
A chip kick is performed from 3 different locations by an opponent robot:

 From a corner to the center of the field From a corner along the long side of the field From the goal to the center
At each location, 4 kicks of different distances are performed.
These distances are 2m, 2.5m, 3m and 3.5m in random order.

A participating team places one robot on the field. The task is to touch the ball
before or shortly after it hits the ground for the first time. This shall imitate the defense problem when the opponent
plays chip kicks.

A participating team has to publish its software which is responsible for detecting chip kicks
and reconstructing the flight trajectory.

Score
Each successfull interception (i.e. the participating robot touches the ball before it hits the ground a second time) gives 3 points. If the ball is kicked instead of simply touched, 1 extra point will be awarded. If the ball is kicked into a goal, 1 further extra point will be awarded. This gives a total number of 60 possible points. 

Multi-Team Communication

The purpose of this challenge is an implementation demonstration of the SSL multi-team communication protocol.
Therefore, two participating teams perform various collaborative tasks using this protocol.
The mixed team has 15 seconds to accomplish each task.
This challenge assumes a simple master-slave relationship between the two collaborating teams.
This is, the master team sends a team plan to the slave team, which acts according to this plan.
In order to evaluate the behavior in accordance to the team plan, the master team
sends the team plan to an evaluator computer (run by the TC). This computer forwards
the team plan to the slave team.

Initial situation for each task
The referee command before the actual tasks is Stop. The robots of both teams
have to be located within 1 meter distance to the middle line between the two goals.
The goalie has to be located in the defense are and has to remain there during all tasks.

Task 1
This task
 is signaled by a GameForce referee command.
All defenders have to move to the own goal, all attackers to the 
opponent goal. Every robot of the joint team except for the goalie
must be assigned either a Defense or Offense RobotRole.
There have to be at least 2 defenders and 2 attackers.
The task is fulfilled when all robots are located within 2 meter 
distance to the particular goal’s center, but not inside the defense or 
attack area.

Task 2
This task is signaled by an Indirect Freekick command for the opponent team (which
is not present at the field).

9 defenders have to be located with less than 10 centimeters distance to the defense area, but
not occupying or touching the defense area. The master team should prescribe the target positions
in order to avoid positioning conflicts.

Task 3
This task is signaled by an Indirect Freekick command for the mixed team.

The master team chooses one of the partner team’s robots and 
plays a pass to this robot. The task is fulfilled
if no other than this robot and the kicker of the freekick touched the 
ball
before it entered the opponent’s goal. The chosen robot of the Slave 
team is indicated
by sending a shot_target to this (and only this) robot in its RobotPlan.
If the ball leaves the field without scoring a goal, or if another robot
 than the two mentioned touched the ball, no points are scored.

Score
Each 
successfully accomplished task gives an 5 points, remaining seconds are 
added up as points. Both teams receive the same amount of points.
This gives a total number of 60 possible points.

The best 4 scoring teams will be qualified to compete in the Mixed Team Challenge.

Two technical challenges and the Mixed team tournament will be held this year.
These challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop technical contributions and to test ideas that can evolve the league towards the RoboCup goal of 2050. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint, and the Committes encourages all the participating teams to compete in the challenges.
Until April 25th, teams interested in participating in any of the challenges or in the Mixed team tournament need to announce their interest to the Organizing Committee . This is necessary for the preparation of the schedules.
Passing and Shooting Challenge
To test the ability of coordinated passing and motion of the teams, in an environment with moving obstacles, the following challenge is proposed: Up to four robots, placed within areas on each side the field, must pass and receive the ball across four moving obstacles, repositioning themselves according to the sequence shown in the figure below and, at the end, score the goal.
Rules
Every received pass scores +1, and every intercepted or missed pass scores -1;There’s a bonus of +3 for scoring the goal;If the ball is intercepted, stops or goes out of bounds, it will be placed on the start position;The moving obstacles will travel at 1m/s speed, with slight variation allowed;The location of the obstacle robots will follow the figure, however their exact position may vary slightly;Robots cannot leave the areas of the field designated for them;Chip kicks are not permitted; – item added as Rule Clarification (June 7th)The size of each passing area is 1.25m x 6.1m, measured from the bounds of the field;Teams have 2 minutes to complete the challenge;Wins the team with higher score.
Pass/Intercept Challenge
Attention: This challenge’s format has changed on April 10th
This challenge tests both the ability to pass the ball in a reduced space, with adversaries, and the ability to intercept the ball when defending. The challenge occurs between two teams, on a half of the field. One of the teams, with up to four robots, tries to pass the ball as many times as possible, while the other team uses two robots to try to intercept the passes. Robots are free to move anywhere, as long as they respect the minimum distance between them, as shown on the picture below. The two teams swap passing and defending roles at the half-time interval.
Rules
Every received pass scores +2 and every intercepted or missed pass scores -1;If the ball is intercepted, goes out of bounds or stops, a referee halt signal will be sent and the ball placed again around the goal kick position;Passing robots must keep minimum distance of 1m between teammates for passing score to be accounted;Defending robots must keep minimum distance of 0.5m from the robot holding the ball;Referee can penalize with -1 each offense to the minimum distance rules;Matches will consist of 2 periods of 2 minutes, with approx. 30 seconds interval between;Team with higher score wins;The challenge will follow eliminatory match style. Brackets will be drawn on the day of the competition.
Mixed Team Tournament
This is a full match between mixed teams, each composed of six robots originating from two different SSL teams. Each robot will be controlled by its originating SSL team software. However, communication between the teams is allowed, as long as there is no direct control of the robots. The tournament format will let teams play matches as members of different mixed teams.
* The exact number of matches and schedule will be announced by the OC after the team confirmation deadline.
Rules
Both teams forming the mixed team must have the same number of robots on the field at the beginning of a match;All SSL rules will apply;Goals are only valid if robots from the two forming teams have touched the ball since the last game stoppage;The mixed teams will be formed by seeding.The winner is based off two round robins, a preliminary and a final one with advanced teams.

RobôCIn
Hi, everyone!
We are proud to announce a series of repositories that we plan to submit at this year’s open-source. Hopefully they will help grow our category here at RoboCup.
RobôCIn’s Plans for Future Software Development
rSoccer: https://github.com/robocin/rSoccer

Is an open-source framework to study Reinforcement Learning for SSL;

project-unification: https://github.com/robocin/project-unification
This project aims to demonstrate the use of the soccer-common framework (https://github.com/robocin/soccer-common), developed by RobôCIn and used in the RoboCup SSL and IEEE VSS categories. Also, the repository serves as a starting point to the team’s new developers and teams that want to start strategies on SSL.
Usage examples:

MatheusPaixaoG: https://github.com/MatheusPaixaoG/project-unification
matheuslafayette: https://github.com/matheuslafayette/projeto-seletivo-robocin
agaf2: https://github.com/agaf2/project-unification
acrucha: https://github.com/acrucha/project-unification
caiomvfc: https://github.com/caiovmfc/Seletiva-RoboCin-VSS-cvmfc

robocin-cpp: https://github.com/robocin/robocin-cpp

It is a library heavily inspired by abseil owned by Google, and seeks to extract what worked well from soccer-common, implementing software engineering best practices and modern C++ with a README-by-folder based documentation. It provides the core library for our next team’s robotics applications.

Floating-point comparison;
Angular/geometric operations;
In the long term it will be like libsrc in 2D for our team.

protocols: https://github.com/robocin/protocols
The protobufs used by the competition are widely dispersed in the repositories that require them, making it necessary to copy and paste the files that are currently being used in the category. Thus, the protocols used are highly duplicated in the RoboCup SSL softwares, but also in the team’s strategy softwares.
In this context, we propose a single repository containing the protocols used by as well as installation guidelines for various programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, etc.
robocin-ines: https://github.com/joseviccruz/robocin-ines, https://github.com/uandersonricardo/robocin-ines-server, https://github.com/uandersonricardo/robocin-ines-webui
robocin-ines provides a base framework for architecting robotic applications. This set of repositories comes as an optimization of our current software (ssl-unification), providing a microservices-based framework which:

Enables the use of different programming languages;
Uses the ZeroMQ framework to communicate services with latency below 1ms;
Defines a visualization on the Web, providing better development simplicity;

However, this final structure is not yet finalized and, as a way to validate the technologies, scope, and robustness of the system, the SSL VAR was developed as an MVP of this repository.
SSL VAR is a match recording system, which allows the viewing of the match in real time, as well as the analysis of past plays through replay at a given timestamp or according to a given event in the match, such as a foul, penalty, or goal. In this way, it allows the human referee to analyze a past play and check whether his decision and also the decisions of the automatic referees were correct or not.
The ultimate goal of this repository is to provide a base structure for organizing new SSL teams using microservices, and to extend the life and maintenance of our current software.Best regards, RobôCIn.
RoboFEI
Dear SSL community,
RoboFEI would like to submit our hardware and software works for the open-source award. We are happy to say that we have released all the mechanics, electronics, AI, and firmware for this year.
Regarding mechanics, the new robot’s generation is fully released on our GitLab (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/ssl-mechanics). The project aims for modularization that will help robot maintenance and assembly.
In electronics, both the main and kick boards have been changed aiming for modularization, besides the fact that the team replaced the FPGA with an STM microcontroller to modernize our robot, and you can see everything here in the link (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/Electronics_v2). Besides that, our new firmware is released on our GitLab too (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/Electronics_v2).
About the software, our ongoing research of multi-robot path-planning is fully released on our GitLab (https://gitlab.com/leo_costa/RobotNavigation).
Best regards,
João VictorRoboFEI
ER-Force
Dear Small Size League.
ER-Force would like to submit their current hardware and software framework as well as its autoref for the open source award. [1, 2, 3]
A short summary:
The hardware project reflects the current state of the ER-Force robots, i.e. the new robot generation used by our team during this RoboCup. The hardware is designed in EAGLE (electronics) and Inventor (mechanics). The electronics section contains prebuilt manufacturer files (Gerber) as well as schematics as PDF, the mechanics part is depicted in assembly drawings.
The software framework reflects the open-source simulator as well as some low level algorithms such as our path planning. The software framework is written in C++ and Qt.
Finally, our open-source projects include our well-known autoref, which is used by the league for many years.
Best regards,
MikeER-Force
TIGERs Mannheim
Dear SSL-Community,
as in the past years we are very happy to announce our entry for theOpen Source Award. The usual one-stop shop to get it all was updated:https://github.com/TIGERs-MannheimWe are doing a complete and full release of everything we have,including electronics, mechanics, firmware, our full AI, and someawesome new tools. Here is a brief description of what has changed.
Mechanics:The dribbler dampening and dribbling bar have changed again to improvetraction on the ball. These are mostly material changes. The axes of thesub-wheels changed to be more robust. The release includes the fullrobot mechanics. Inventor CAD files, but also a STEP file of the full robot.
Firmware:Dribbler current control has been improved near zero velocity. Interfaceto the robot’s raspberry pi has been improved with new messages andfeedback of detected balls. The release also includes our wirelessprotocol and base station firmware.
Software (AI):The heart and brain of our team, the central control software “Sumatra”.Of course, compatible with the simulation protocol. So you can test yourAI against ours locally. Pass finding has been largely improved and nowcontains a dynamic learning component. Also watch out for some moreserious dribbling moves which will make you sweat.
RobotPi:The software for ball detection running on a Raspberry Pi 3A+ on each ofour robots. Most of the color blob detection and thresholding has beenrewritten and is parallelized via multi-threading. The RPi uses onlyaround 50% of its CPU now.
TIGERs CLAV (Cut Lengthy Audio/Video):This is an C++ ImGui based application able to cut video files based onan SSL gamelog. You can synchronize multiple videos and gamelogs withindividual markers and the tool can then cut out non-running stages.This tool is still quite new and may not support every video format, butnonetheless it is already a great help to preprocess videos frommatches. Oh and it can create a status overlay video for your videos,too (similar to the status board).
In case you are missing any information or if you are just curios,contact us on Discord or write us an email.
Tigertastic Greetings,TIGERs Mannheim
RoboTeam Twente
Dear SSL community,
Hereby, RoboTeam Twente would like to submit our projects for the Open Source Award.
RoboTeam Twente WikiRoboTeam Twente AI SoftwareRoboTeam Twente EmbeddedRoboTeam Twente AutoRefHigh Speed USB Library for STM32Chat-TDP
Our Wiki provides all the mechanical and electrical designs of our robots. Furthermore, it contains the theoretical background and additional explanations about our AI and control software.On our Github you can find our new path planning within our AI code, as well as our innovative dribbler ball-sensor code (see this year’s ETDP).
This year we created an AutoRef, allowing for a majority vote between all AutoRefs. This software is under active development, but our AutoRef will most likely be used during RoboCup 2023.
Next to that, we developed a high speed USB library compatible with our STM32 chip. This results in an enhanced stability when connecting USB devices to the STM32F676ZI. With minor modifications, this is also suitable for other STM chips.Lastly, our latest innovation is our very own Chat-GPT, containing all information on all the (E)TDPs within the SSL. Just ask your question, and the answer will be provided. This Chat-TDP is currently still under construction, but great progress has already been made and we feel like this could be beneficial for all teams within SSL.
Thank you!
luhbots Soccer

RoboJackets
Hello SSL community,
RoboJackets would like to submit our open source work for this SSL award. 
Printed Circuit BoardsRRT Path PlanningGUI, High Level Planning, and Strategy SoftwareFreeRTOS firmware
All information regarding documentation can be found within the repositories. RoboJackets has made all parts of our development open source (RobotCAD is currently unavailable due to GrabCAD being down, and we are searching for alternatives). Some of the main innovations involve practical applications of ROS2 for software and FreeRTOS for on-board robot control. Another goal of ours this year was increased documentation: for example software documentation can be found at this website.
Thank you,
RoboJackets, Georgia Tech

* All deadlines are by the end of the day at any place on Earth

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions until the Team Qualification Material Submission Deadline, which is specified at the beginning of the page:

Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).
Submit a Team Video.
Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2023 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

Team Name
Country
University
Main contact name and email
Website (if you have one)
Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be made via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs must follow these guidelines:

The TDP must contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP must focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations must be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP must have a clear structure and it must be written in clear English.
The TDP must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions. Contrary to the requirements in the linked document the (E)TDP should also include page numbers.
The TDP must be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP must describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
Like last year we have set up a conference management system to handle the peer review process. It is accessible via this link: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2023
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existing account, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To create an account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. To submit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.
TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020 – This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardware improvements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also the reasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for other teams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier for reviewers to read it. It also has no overlaps with the team’s previous paper.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper – This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planning system. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significant changes in that area, and mentioning them would only mean having overlap with the previous paper. The size of the paper is also not excessively long.  
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020 – This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, the mechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It is a bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers each topic well and does not have overlap with the previous paper. 

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time. As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could be significantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. The qualification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old. Due to the COVID pandemic we allow to use a video from 2019, especially from participating in RoboCup Sydney, too. If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams to prove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If your video is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match, teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (see listing below).  The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. For participating in Division A, teams also have to show their ball placement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2023 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in a modern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions by January 21st, 2020:
Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).Submit a Team Video (see instructions below).Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2020 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:Team NameCountryUniversityMain contact name and emailWebsite (if you have one)Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)Short rationale for the preferred division
Please pay attention to the following points:
Communication will be made via e-mail, using the Small Size mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.There are two divisions with separate tournaments: division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The teams may choose the division they want to play in, but the OC will have the final word.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every division B team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) and every division A team an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The TDP should contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.The TDP should focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations should be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.The TDP should have a clear structure and it should be written in clear English.The TDP should be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions.
In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The ETDP should describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.The ETDP should be at least 6 pages long.
Submission Information
We have set up a conference management system to handle this years peer review process. It can be accessed at https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2020. 
To create an account, click on “Register”, next to the “New to CMT?” text. To submit a paper, click on the top left button “Create a new submission”.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage and be under 2 minutes long. The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

DOCUMENT 22
SOURCE: https://ssl.robocup.org/robocups/robocup-2010-technical-challenges/
CONTENT:
In 2010, we have two technical challenges. These two challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop interesting technical contributions. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint. Both are designed to be scalable, i.e. every team can participate without much special preparation. Of course, teams who spend extra time on preparing the challenge are more likely to benefit from their work. Please note that both of these two challenges have changed from their respective 2009 versions. All challenges must use the new SSL Shared Vision system and the new standard robot pattern.
Until June 4th (two weeks before the start of the competition), each team that is interested in participating in the challenge has to announce its interest to the OC. This is necessary for the preparation of the schedule.
Mixed Team Challenge – Shooting and Passing
One of the aims of the Small Size League is to foster the development of cooperating agents. The current state of the art is to control all members of one team by a central intelligence instance which has a complete knowledge about the current state of each robot. Even in teams which have a distributed artificial intelligence component, every robot has detailed information about the behaviours of its team members and thus can deduce actions which lead to an overall cooperative behaviour of the whole team. The aim of this challenge is to define a scenario for “real” cooperation, i.e. to let robots cooperate which do not have any knowledge about the internal state of all other robots of their team. This is intended to become realized by mixing existing teams.
A mixed team is defined:
For the 2010 challenge, we consider a mixed team as a team of four robots originating from two different SSL teams. Each of these two sub-teams has to provide two robots. Each sub-team controls their robots with their own software stack. Of course, all members of a mixed team have the same team marker colour. For this year, there will not be any communication between the different sub-teams. A mixed team must use the new SSL Shared Vision system and the new standard robot pattern.
For creating the mixed teams, the following approach will be applied:
After the round robin stage of the soccer competition (i.e. on Tuesday afternoon), the teams for the “Mixed Team Challenge” are separated into two groups. In both groups, every team has to pair with every other team and perform the challenge task. The two best teams from each group will process to the final round according to their score. These teams have to pair with every other team and perform the challenge task again. The total ranking of the challenge can be determined as follows:
The first four teams are ranked by only the number of goals they scored in the final round.The remaining teams are ranked by the number of goals their scored.
The Challenge
Put up two robots from each different teams on the field and score as many goals as possible within 120 seconds. Points are awarded as follows:
1 Point: Scoring a goal after two robots from different teams have touched the ball (i.e. after a pass*)2 Points: Scoring a goal after the ball has been touched at least three times by alternating robots (i.e. after at least two passes*)
*A pass will only be considering as valid if it has involved robots originating from two different teams.
The rules for this challenge:
To start, the mixed team chooses a side of the field. All robots must be placed within 1m from their team’s goal line. Opponent robots will be placed on the field as obstacles. A ball will be placed near one of the corners at the mixed team’s own side of the field. A goal can be scored only when the kicking robot is in the opponent’s half. Once a goal is scored or the ball has left the field, it will be placed again near one of the corners at the own side of the field.

Open Challenge
This challenge is designed to encourage creativity within the Small-Size League, allowing teams to demonstrate interesting research on autonomous mobile robot systems. Each team will demonstrate their research on a standard Small Size League 2010 field, and has to use one or more Small Size League robot(s) as part of the demonstration. In this open challenge, hardware modifications or extensions to the small size robot(s) are acceptable, even if not fully compliant to the standard SSL game rules, as long as the demonstration poses no risk to the people, the field, or the equipment. Teams may use the SSL-Vision system that is provided. Teams are not allowed to mount any additional equipment to the overhead camera bar. Teams can demonstrate their open challenge topics as much as they like within three minute. Each team may also distribute a short presentation or a page of a paper to describe their research. The winner will be decided by a vote from SSL team leaders using a Barda count. Each team will list their top 10 teams in order (excluding themselves). The teams are encouraged to evaluate the performance based on these criteria: Technical strength, novelty, expected impact, and relevance to the league. The time of vote will be within 30 minutes after the last demonstration. Each ranking from each team is converted to points: 10 points for top ranking, 9 points for second, down to 1 point for 10th. Any points awarded by a team to itself will be disregarded. The points awarded by the teams are summed. The team with the highest total score will be the winner of this challenge.
Overall Challenge Ranking
The results from two challenges will be combined to get an overall technical challenge ranking.
To combine the challenge results, we will use the following formula:
Let MIXED_1_SUM be the sum of all points in a group that all teams in a group received in the first round of the mixed team challenge, MIX_2_SUM be the sum of all points that all teams received in the final round of the mixed team challenge, MIXED_1_TEAM be the number of points a single team received in the first round and MIXED_2_TEAM be the number of points a single team received in the final round.
Let OPEN_SUM be the sum of all points that all teams received in open challenge and OPEN_TEAM be the number of points a single team received.
Then
TOTAL_TEAM = ( (MIXED_1_TEAM / MIXED_1_SUM) + (MIX_2_TEAM / MIXED_2_SUM) )/2 + OPEN_TEAM / OPEN_SUM
Time and Fields
The challenge will be conducted during the first and second days in the competition.
Optional Game Demo
If some teams volunteer to show a mixed full 5 vs. 5 SSL soccer match, we would strongly appreciate and support this. Nevertheless, this will not be considered for the overall challenge ranking.

Dear SSL community,
Since the end of 2020, we have been releasing a good number of repositories as open source software. We are doing it for two main reasons.
Firstly, we believe on the give-a-penny-take-a-pennyconcept. Based on this principle, since we are daily using lots of open source software developed by the Small Size League Community, we should also share our software in a sign of gratitude, in a way of contributing to the community have always supported us.
Secondly, we believe that sharing software is important for educational purposes, we have learned a lot from open source software (like how to rewrite and reuse a piece of software) and we hope that, releasing our software to the public, we can help others in that way too. Sharing software is equivalent to sharing knowledge, which is beneficial for everyone.
Below you will find our publications on the last year:
Software (SSL-Strategy)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy>
Languages:C++ (almost 99% of the source code); Python; QMake
This is the software that we use during RoboCup matches. Its main purpose is to control one team during a Small Size League game. The GUI is highly customizable (with options like selecting number of defenders and offenders, the maximum speed of the robots, the maximum strength of a kick and so on). It has a nice graphical client for visualizing the field and some options, like the interaction with the simulator.
The source code and the interface are all in Brazilian Portuguese idiom, so it might be difficult to use it for non-Portuguese speakers. Nevertheless, we are planning to add an English translation to the software; that way, the GUI could be used in both, English and Portuguese languages.
Software (LogAnalyserRoboFEI-SSL)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/LogAnalyserRoboFei-SSL>
Languages:C++; QMake
This software is based on the Robocup Small Size League C++ Log Tools (https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-logtools) and on the RoboFEI Small Size League Main Software (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy).
It provides a simple log player combined with a graphical client can that read vision and referee messages (from the network or directly from the log player). Furthermore it provides more options for loading and playing a match log file; for example, it is possible to ignore the match states when the game is stopped or halted and consider the other states. The Kalman filter from our main software is also embedded with the application.
Other additional functionalities like, download the Match League Log Files directly from the software and the use of predefined shortcuts provides an easy environment for the user watch Small Size League matches recorded or in real time.
At last, the Enable Analysis option activates a feature that can check when a shoot move or pass move occurs and evaluates this move in a 0 to 250 scale. At the end, a file is generated with the results. We are working on an implementation that provides a game statistics viewer tool that shows statistics of the game (like the ball possession, the amount of passes and pass precision, shoots to goal and so on), but it is still in development.
Software (JoystickRobotController):
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/joystickrobotcontroller>
Languages:C++; QMake
The objective of this software is to easily test the RoboFEI robots – verifying if the robots wheels, kick sensor, dribbler, and other components are working properly. It makes it possible to control the robot, either with a joystick controller or with a computer keyboard.
Sincerely,
The RoboFEI team.

SOURCE: https://ssl.robocup.org/robocups/robocup-2015/robocup-2015-technical-challenges/
CONTENT:
Two technical challenges will be held at RoboCup 2015. These challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop technical contributions and to test ideas that can evolve the league towards the RoboCup goal of 2050. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint, and the Committees encourage all the participating teams to compete in the challenges.
11-vs-11 Mixed Team Challenge
The 11 on 11 Technical challenge is a full match between two teams of up to 11 robots, each composed of robots from two different SSL teams (here referred to as sub-teams). Each robot must be controlled by its originating sub-team’s software. Sub-team pairings will be randomly drawn. The winners will be determined based on the number of valid goals scored.
Communication
Communication between the two sub-teams of a team is allowed, according to the following specifications:
Messages are sent as UDP packets encoded with Google protobuf to port 10012.Sub-teams communicate only a rough plan for each of their robots using the TeamPlan message specified by the multi_team_communication.proto Google protobuf:
 package multi_team_comm;
 //Protocol to communicate rough plans to other teammates
 //Units are specified as follows:
 //length - millimeters
 //time - seconds
 //angle - radians
 
 //Plan of a list of robots
 message TeamPlan {
   repeated RobotPlan plans = 1;
 }
 
 //Plan of a single robot
 message RobotPlan {
   //ID of the robot from SSL vision
   required uint32 robot_id = 1;
   //Role that this robot is assuming
   // 0 - no specified role
   // 1 - goalie
   // 2 - defense
   // 3 - offense
   optional int32 role = 2;
   //Planned navigation target
   optional Pose nav_target = 3;
   //Planned shot target
   optional Location shot_target = 4;
 }
 
 // Location message, in mm. The center of the field is specified as (0, 0).
 // Positive x axis points to the opponent's goal
 message Location {
   required int32 x = 1;
   required int32 y = 2;
 }
 
 message Pose {
   //location of the robot
   optional Location loc = 1;
   //heading of the robot
   optional float heading = 2;
 };

Rules
Standard SSL rules apply to mixed team games with the following additions:
A mixed team is formed from robots of two sub-teams.The maximum robot number is increased to 11 per mixed team. Each sub-team may have only a maximum of 5 players on the field at any time. Each sub-team may additionally provide a goalkeeper for one period. The goal keeper for the second period must not be provided by the same sub-team that provided the goalkeeper for the first period.Goals are only valid if robots from both of the two sub-teams forming a mixed team have touched the ball since the last stoppage of play.
Shared Radio Protocol Challenge
Overview
The goal of the shared radio protocol is to demonstrate teams playing soccer using other teams’ robots. This will allow (for example) teams of heterogeneous hardware, or mixed teams with one team’s software and another’s hardware.
For this technical challenge, the team that provides the robot hardware will be called the Radio Server Team (RST), and the team that controls the robots via software will be called the Radio Client Team (RCT). The RST will run a server that accepts data on the UDP port number 10010, receives the radio commands in the specified protobuf format, and send the commands over their own radio to the robots. The RCT will run the control software that will send radio commands in the specified protobuf format to the UDP port 10010 of the RST. This setup is depicted in the following figure:
Radio Protocol
The radio commands are sent as UDP packets encoded with Google protobuf, with the following protobuf definitions. Each wrapper packet contains multiple radio commands, for each of the robots to be controlled.
message RadioProtocolWrapper {
  repeated RadioProtocolCommand command = 1;
}

message RadioProtocolCommand {
  // The unique ID of the robot, as identified by SSL-Vision.
  required int32 robot_id = 1;

  // Desired forward drive velocity in meters / second.
  required float velocity_x = 2;

  // Desired sideways left drive velocity in meters / second.
  required float velocity_y = 3;

  // Desired counterclockwise angular velocity in radians / second.
  required float velocity_r = 4;

  // Desired flat kick speed, in meters / second.
  // If this optional field is missing, then no flat kick command should be
  // sent.
  optional float flat_kick = 5;

  // Desired chip kick distance, in meters.
  // If this optional field is missing, then no flat kick command should be
  // sent. If this field is present along with the flat_kick field, the
  // flat_kick command takes precedence.
  optional float chip_kick = 6;

  // Desired dribbler spin, from -1 to +1, where -1 is the maximum reverse-spin
  // that can be imparted to the ball, and +1 is the maximum forward-spin
  // that can be imparted to the ball.
  optional float dribbler_spin = 7;
}

Source Code
Source code for the defined protobufs, and sample RST and RCT executables, is available on GitHub.
Scoring
Both teams, the RST and the RCT are awarded the specified number of points each for every skill from the following list that they perform:
Driving a single robot in a straight line along the length of the field twice, from touching one goal line to the other goal line at the other end of the field, and back, along the middle of the field (1 point)Intercepting a moving ball travelling at ≥ 1 m/s, and bringing it to a stop. (1 point)Scoring a goal against a stopped defence consisting of centrally placed goalie and 2 defenders (1 point)Scoring a goal against a stopped defence consisting of centrally placed goalie and 2 defenders by a one-touch (deflection) kick of a moving ball travelling at ≥ 1 m/s. (2 points)Scoring a goal on the stopped defence after a pass between two robots (2 points).Scoring a goal on a moving 3-robot defence after a pass between two robots (2 points).
The skills will be evaluated as follows:
For skills involving moving balls, the ball will be rolled in by a human from the goal line towards the center of the field.For the skills involving scoring goals, the trials are started from game off state with the ball at the center of the field.For direct goal scoring, a force start referee command will be sent. For indirect goal scoring with passes, an indirect free kick referee command will be sent.Points are scored only once per skill. No additional points are awarded for repeating a skill, either to the RST, or RCT, with the same, or any other RST-RCT pairing.The RST team will be monitoring the computer, commands sent, and the robots, and may, at their discretion, abort the communication and end the trial at any time.The RCT and RST must both take appropriate precautions to maintain safety of the robots, and are expected to partake in the challenge in fair spirit. The RCT will not be held liable for any possible damage to the RST’s robots.
Procedure
Order of the challenge demonstrations, and pairings: [To Be Determined]

Field Configuration

The RoboCup 2019 will feature 3 fields.
Field A: 9x12m, used for official games of division AField B: 6x9m, used for official games of division BField C: 6x9m, used for testing (both divisions)
The time before the scheduled start of official games is reserved for the two opposing teams of the next match. If there is no time left between the end of a match and the scheduled start of the next match, testing time on the playing field cannot be granted.
On field C, testing time slots will be distributed by the OC. There will be two options:
One team can use the entire fieldTwo teams can use half of the field
After all games of the day have finished, all teams are free to test on either field. If there is too much demand, the OC will also coordinate it.
Division A Tournament Format

Teams in division A will play a round robin group stage followed by a double elimination playoff stageThere are two groups, with 4 teams eachAll teams start in the upper bracket of the double elimination stageThe results of the group stage determine the matches of the first round of the double elimination stage
Group Stage
There are two seeding poolsEvery group consists of two teams from pool 1 and two teams from pool 2The pools were decided using the results of previous official tournamentsThe rule that there is no more than 1 team from the same country in the same group will not be usedThe groups will be assigned using the SSL grouping tool and random.org

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested in participating must complete the followingactions by the Team Qualification Material Submission Deadline, whichis specified at the beginning of the page:

Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).
Submit a Team Video.
Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2025 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

Team Name
Country
University
Main contact’s name and email
Website (if you have one)
Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be conducted via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of thequalification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submitqualification video material demonstrating their true currentcapabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) whatis expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting the minimumrequired criteria will only be considered for inclusion after all teams thatsubmitted compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separatetournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advancedteams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B.Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will havethe final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such ateam will attend as one team and must submit all qualificationmaterials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiplecomputers.

 
Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a TeamDescription Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP.Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams thatpresent substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCuptournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs must follow these guidelines:

The TDP must contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP must focus on innovations that the team has produced withrespect to their previous TDPs. These innovations must be described indetail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP must have a clear structure and it must be written in clear English.
The TDP must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions. Contrary to the requirements in the linked document the (E)TDP should also include page numbers.
The TDP must be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long. This does not include references.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP must describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team mustbring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. Theposter must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will behung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
Like last year we have set up a conference management system to handle the peer review process. It is accessible via this link: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2025
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existingaccount, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To createan account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. Tosubmit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Qualification Process

After the Team Qualification Material Submission Deadline, the OC will reach out by email to all teams that submitted the three required materials for qualification (video, participation intent, (E)TDP). This starts the single-blind peer-review phase: Each team is assigned three (E)TDPs and is tasked to review them, answer basic questions about the submissions and share concerns and ideas for improvement with the team and/or the TC/OC.
To keep the review single-blind, please avoid self-identifying yourself or your team in the comments or shared media. The single-blind review is important to us because it allows reviewers to share their concerns or criticize the submission without fear for retaliation.Failure to meaningfully review the submissions may result in disqualification of your team!
After the TDP Peer Review Deadline but on or before the Preliminary Team Qualification Results Announcement, TC/OC will contact each team (again, by email) to announce to them one of the following four Preliminary Qualification Status:

Qualified: If the video and the (E)TDP are of sufficient quality, a team is directly qualified for the RoboCup. They are still encouraged to improve their (E)TDP by incorporating relevant feedback, but this isn’t required to participate. Teams can (in extreme cases) lose their qualified status – by prolonged failure to reply to OCs emails that are crucial for running the competition. Qualified teams can withdraw for any reason from the competition by announcing their withdrawal to the OC. Teams are encouraged to announce their withdrawal as soon as they know to allow for teams to move up from the waiting list (and to allow for a smooth organization).
On the waiting list: We have to limit the number of participants for the RoboCup. If the number of applicants is higher than our capacity, we give out slots based on initial qualification material quality (with a higher significance on (E)TDP quality), and a few slots are given out by chance. Teams who have otherwise qualified, but who haven’t managed to get a slot are on the waiting list. In their email announcing this to the team, TC/OC includes the current position on the waiting list (ranked by qualification material quality). If a qualified team withdraws, TC/OC will go through the waiting list in order and search for a replacement team. Keep an eye on your emails! If you are on the waiting list and want to withdraw, please also announce that to the OC to speed up the process.
Conditionally Qualified: If the video and/or the (E)TDP have major flaws, teams are usually conditionally qualified. In their email announcing this decision, TC/OC gives a list of conditions the team has to meet by the Final TDP Submission Deadline to be allowed to compete in the RoboCup. Failure to do so will result in disqualification.
Not qualified: In extremely rare cases (with a unanimous vote in TC/OC) a bad (E)TDP submission can result in the team being not qualified, without a second chance to improve their submission. This is only for extreme cases, and reflects that conditional qualification is a huge drain on scarce resources: While your initial (E)TDP was reviewed by three of your peers, checking your updated (E)TDP after a conditional qualification has to be done by TC/OC members. Initially submitting an (E)TDP that clearly isn’t even close to be acceptable for qualification and planning on writing a decent one only for the final (E)TDP Submission Deadline is disrespectful towards your peers who had to waste time on a review you are not interested in, and is requiring the TC/OC to do a full review of your submission themselves.

TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020– This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardwareimprovements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also thereasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for otherteams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier forreviewers to read it. It also has no (self-)plagiarism.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper– This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planningsystem. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significantchanges in that area, and mentioning them would only mean havingduplicate information. The paper is also notexcessively long.
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020– This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, themechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It isa bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers eachtopic well and it has no (self-)plagiarism.
 
Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time.As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could resultsignificantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. Thequalification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old.If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams toprove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If yourvideo is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match,teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (seelisting below). The qualification video can be either of the followingtypes, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game(i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). Thevideo should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. Forparticipating in Division A, teams also have to show their ballplacement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a teamto compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams inthe qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
 
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2025 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in amodern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

Dear SSL community,
as in past years, we are happy to submit our entry for the Open SourceAward.
You will find a list of our publications below.
Framework + Simulator:
This is the main software we use to develop and test our AI. It is able to– receive and process real life vision data– simulate SSL games– control robots– create game recordings and play them back…and much more.
New features since last years RoboCup include:– A new dribbling filter– Basic Git integration (i.e. show the Commit the binary is built from)Git integration into our log format will be released soon afterRoboCup– Various bug fixes and small features
The repository also contains our simulator, bundled as a standaloneexecutable for usage in this years RoboCup.
https://github.com/robotics-erlangen/framework
Autoref
This is our automatic referee, that detects the various ruleinfringements teams can commit during a SSL game.
https://github.com/robotics-erlangen/autoref
In case you have questions about our software or are just curious, feelwelcome to write an email to info@robotics-erlangen.de
Best regardsPaul BergmannER-Force
RoboTeam Twente
Dear SSL-Community,
For the first year since competing RoboTeam Twente is ready to enter for the Open Source Award. As all of our team members change (almost) in full every year we strive to have detailed and easy to understand documentation for everyone. This means that apart from all our designs we have collected all our recent how-to’s, design decisions and detailed explanations into a wiki. This wiki we also use to introduce new people to our team, so we hope it can be especially helpful for newer teams and those who are looking into tips for building enough robots to transition to division A.
Our wiki can be found here: https://wiki.roboteamtwente.nl/
Although the wiki also describes all previously made design in terms of hardware and software, some highlights of the changes we made this year include:
– Transitioning to a modular design with hardware and electronics combined for faster repair and more extensive testing. (rationale)- A fully renewed Front Assembly, which contains our dribbler and a new dampening mechanism. (design | rationale)– Custom made space-saving solenoids for kicking and chipping which freed up quite some space in our robots. (design | rationale)– Newly designed path planning based on bang-bang trajectories. (rationale)
We hope this can help other teams in their process of improving the SSL robots. If you have any questions we are more than happy to answer them, and if you find it useful we would love to hear that from you. We look forward to seeing you all at the RoboCup!
Kind regards,
Anne van Harten | RoboTeam Twente
RoboFEI
Dear SSL community,
Since the end of 2020, we have been releasing a good number of repositories as open source software. We are doing it for two main reasons.
Firstly, we believe on the give-a-penny-take-a-penny concept. Based on this principle, since we are daily using lots of open source software developed by the Small Size League Community, we should also share our software in a sign of gratitude, in a way of contributing to the community that have always supported us.
Secondly, we believe that sharing software is important for educational purposes, we have learned a lot from open source software (like how to rewrite and reuse a piece of software) and we hope that, releasing our software to the public, we can help others in that way too. Sharing software is equivalent to sharing knowledge, which is beneficial for everyone.
Below you will find our repositories.
Software (SSL-Strategy)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy>
Languages: C++ (almost 99% of the source code); Python; QMake
This is the software that we use during RoboCup matches. Its main purpose is to control one team during a Small Size League game. The GUI is highly customizable (with options like selecting number of defenders and offenders, the maximum speed of the robots, the maximum strength of a kick and so on). It has a nice graphical client for visualizing the field and some options, like the interaction with the simulator.
To improve the quality and usefulness of our open-source material we’ve started slowly changing our code base from portuguese to english. Although it demands a great effort to translate all the previous code, we believe that this should greatly improve the accessibility of our code base to the league.
Software (LogAnalyserRoboFEI-SSL)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/LogAnalyserRoboFei-SSL>
Languages: C++; QMake
This software is based on the Robocup Small Size League C++ Log Tools (https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-logtools) and on the RoboFEI Small Size League Main Software (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy).
It provides a simple log player combined with a graphical client can that read vision and referee messages (from the network or directly from the log player). Furthermore it provides more options for loading and playing a match log file; for example, it is possible to ignore the match states when the game is stopped or halted and consider the other states. The Kalman filter from our main software is also embedded with the application.
At last, the Enable Analysis option activates a feature that can check when a shoot move or pass move occurs and it in a 0 to 250 scale. At the end of the game, the software generates the information of all moves occurred on the match.
We are working on an implementation that provides a game statistics viewer tool that shows statistics of the game (like the ball possession, the amount of passes and pass precision, shoots to goal and so on), but it is still in development.
Software (JoystickRobotController):
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/joystickrobotcontroller>
Languages:C++; QMake
The objective of this software is to easily test the RoboFEI robots – verifying if the robots wheels, kick sensor, dribbler, and other components are working properly. It makes it possible to control the robot, either with a joystick controller or with a computer keyboard.
Sincerely,
The RoboFEI team.
TIGERs Mannheim
Dear SSL-community,
as in the past years we are very happy to announce our entry for theOpen Source Award. By now there is a one-stop shop to get it all:https://github.com/TIGERs-MannheimWe are doing a complete and full release of everything we have,including electronics, mechanics, and our full AI. Here is a briefdescription of what has changed.
Mechanics:The kicker and dribbler have been slightly updated to be more robust.The dribbler now allows prolonged periods of dribbling with highertorque. The release includes the full robot mechanics.
Firmware:The build system has been changed to CMake and the folder structure hasbeen reorganized. The dribbler control algorithm now allows bettercurrent and speed control. Test and model identification methods havebeen cleaned up and improved. The release also includes our wirelessprotocol and base station firmware.
Software (AI):The heart and brain of our team, the central control software “Sumatra”.Of course, compatible with the simulation protocol. So you can test yourAI against ours locally. Watch out for some serious dribbling moveswhich will make you sweat 😉
In case you are missing any information or if you are just curios,contact us on Discord or write us an email.
Tigertastic Greetings,TIGERs Mannheim

RobôCIn
Hi, everyone!
We are proud to announce a series of repositories that we plan to submit at this year’s open-source. Hopefully they will help grow our category here at RoboCup.
RobôCIn’s Plans for Future Software Development
rSoccer: https://github.com/robocin/rSoccer

Is an open-source framework to study Reinforcement Learning for SSL;

project-unification: https://github.com/robocin/project-unification
This project aims to demonstrate the use of the soccer-common framework (https://github.com/robocin/soccer-common), developed by RobôCIn and used in the RoboCup SSL and IEEE VSS categories. Also, the repository serves as a starting point to the team’s new developers and teams that want to start strategies on SSL.
Usage examples:

MatheusPaixaoG: https://github.com/MatheusPaixaoG/project-unification
matheuslafayette: https://github.com/matheuslafayette/projeto-seletivo-robocin
agaf2: https://github.com/agaf2/project-unification
acrucha: https://github.com/acrucha/project-unification
caiomvfc: https://github.com/caiovmfc/Seletiva-RoboCin-VSS-cvmfc

robocin-cpp: https://github.com/robocin/robocin-cpp

It is a library heavily inspired by abseil owned by Google, and seeks to extract what worked well from soccer-common, implementing software engineering best practices and modern C++ with a README-by-folder based documentation. It provides the core library for our next team’s robotics applications.

Floating-point comparison;
Angular/geometric operations;
In the long term it will be like libsrc in 2D for our team.

protocols: https://github.com/robocin/protocols
The protobufs used by the competition are widely dispersed in the repositories that require them, making it necessary to copy and paste the files that are currently being used in the category. Thus, the protocols used are highly duplicated in the RoboCup SSL softwares, but also in the team’s strategy softwares.
In this context, we propose a single repository containing the protocols used by as well as installation guidelines for various programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, etc.
robocin-ines: https://github.com/joseviccruz/robocin-ines, https://github.com/uandersonricardo/robocin-ines-server, https://github.com/uandersonricardo/robocin-ines-webui
robocin-ines provides a base framework for architecting robotic applications. This set of repositories comes as an optimization of our current software (ssl-unification), providing a microservices-based framework which:

Enables the use of different programming languages;
Uses the ZeroMQ framework to communicate services with latency below 1ms;
Defines a visualization on the Web, providing better development simplicity;

However, this final structure is not yet finalized and, as a way to validate the technologies, scope, and robustness of the system, the SSL VAR was developed as an MVP of this repository.
SSL VAR is a match recording system, which allows the viewing of the match in real time, as well as the analysis of past plays through replay at a given timestamp or according to a given event in the match, such as a foul, penalty, or goal. In this way, it allows the human referee to analyze a past play and check whether his decision and also the decisions of the automatic referees were correct or not.
The ultimate goal of this repository is to provide a base structure for organizing new SSL teams using microservices, and to extend the life and maintenance of our current software.Best regards, RobôCIn.

Dear SSL community,
RoboFEI would like to submit our hardware and software works for the open-source award. We are happy to say that we have released all the mechanics, electronics, AI, and firmware for this year.
Regarding mechanics, the new robot’s generation is fully released on our GitLab (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/ssl-mechanics). The project aims for modularization that will help robot maintenance and assembly.
In electronics, both the main and kick boards have been changed aiming for modularization, besides the fact that the team replaced the FPGA with an STM microcontroller to modernize our robot, and you can see everything here in the link (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/Electronics_v2). Besides that, our new firmware is released on our GitLab too (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/Electronics_v2).
About the software, our ongoing research of multi-robot path-planning is fully released on our GitLab (https://gitlab.com/leo_costa/RobotNavigation).
Best regards,
João VictorRoboFEI
ER-Force
Dear Small Size League.
ER-Force would like to submit their current hardware and software framework as well as its autoref for the open source award. [1, 2, 3]
A short summary:
The hardware project reflects the current state of the ER-Force robots, i.e. the new robot generation used by our team during this RoboCup. The hardware is designed in EAGLE (electronics) and Inventor (mechanics). The electronics section contains prebuilt manufacturer files (Gerber) as well as schematics as PDF, the mechanics part is depicted in assembly drawings.
The software framework reflects the open-source simulator as well as some low level algorithms such as our path planning. The software framework is written in C++ and Qt.
Finally, our open-source projects include our well-known autoref, which is used by the league for many years.
Best regards,
MikeER-Force

Dear SSL-Community,
as in the past years we are very happy to announce our entry for theOpen Source Award. The usual one-stop shop to get it all was updated:https://github.com/TIGERs-MannheimWe are doing a complete and full release of everything we have,including electronics, mechanics, firmware, our full AI, and someawesome new tools. Here is a brief description of what has changed.
Mechanics:The dribbler dampening and dribbling bar have changed again to improvetraction on the ball. These are mostly material changes. The axes of thesub-wheels changed to be more robust. The release includes the fullrobot mechanics. Inventor CAD files, but also a STEP file of the full robot.
Firmware:Dribbler current control has been improved near zero velocity. Interfaceto the robot’s raspberry pi has been improved with new messages andfeedback of detected balls. The release also includes our wirelessprotocol and base station firmware.
Software (AI):The heart and brain of our team, the central control software “Sumatra”.Of course, compatible with the simulation protocol. So you can test yourAI against ours locally. Pass finding has been largely improved and nowcontains a dynamic learning component. Also watch out for some moreserious dribbling moves which will make you sweat.
RobotPi:The software for ball detection running on a Raspberry Pi 3A+ on each ofour robots. Most of the color blob detection and thresholding has beenrewritten and is parallelized via multi-threading. The RPi uses onlyaround 50% of its CPU now.
TIGERs CLAV (Cut Lengthy Audio/Video):This is an C++ ImGui based application able to cut video files based onan SSL gamelog. You can synchronize multiple videos and gamelogs withindividual markers and the tool can then cut out non-running stages.This tool is still quite new and may not support every video format, butnonetheless it is already a great help to preprocess videos frommatches. Oh and it can create a status overlay video for your videos,too (similar to the status board).
In case you are missing any information or if you are just curios,contact us on Discord or write us an email.
Tigertastic Greetings,TIGERs Mannheim
RoboTeam Twente
Dear SSL community,
Hereby, RoboTeam Twente would like to submit our projects for the Open Source Award.
RoboTeam Twente WikiRoboTeam Twente AI SoftwareRoboTeam Twente EmbeddedRoboTeam Twente AutoRefHigh Speed USB Library for STM32Chat-TDP
Our Wiki provides all the mechanical and electrical designs of our robots. Furthermore, it contains the theoretical background and additional explanations about our AI and control software.On our Github you can find our new path planning within our AI code, as well as our innovative dribbler ball-sensor code (see this year’s ETDP).
This year we created an AutoRef, allowing for a majority vote between all AutoRefs. This software is under active development, but our AutoRef will most likely be used during RoboCup 2023.
Next to that, we developed a high speed USB library compatible with our STM32 chip. This results in an enhanced stability when connecting USB devices to the STM32F676ZI. With minor modifications, this is also suitable for other STM chips.Lastly, our latest innovation is our very own Chat-GPT, containing all information on all the (E)TDPs within the SSL. Just ask your question, and the answer will be provided. This Chat-TDP is currently still under construction, but great progress has already been made and we feel like this could be beneficial for all teams within SSL.
Thank you!

RoboJackets
Hello SSL community,
RoboJackets would like to submit our open source work for this SSL award. 
Printed Circuit BoardsRRT Path PlanningGUI, High Level Planning, and Strategy SoftwareFreeRTOS firmware
All information regarding documentation can be found within the repositories. RoboJackets has made all parts of our development open source (RobotCAD is currently unavailable due to GrabCAD being down, and we are searching for alternatives). Some of the main innovations involve practical applications of ROS2 for software and FreeRTOS for on-board robot control. Another goal of ours this year was increased documentation: for example software documentation can be found at this website.
Thank you,
RoboJackets, Georgia Tech

* All deadlines are by the end of the day at any place on Earth

RoboCup 2020/2021

Due to the circumstances in January 2021, RoboCup 2021 will be a fully virtual / decentralized event. All teams, even already qualified teams via the Qualification for RoboCup 2020 are advised to read the following point carefully.
Evey team intending on participating in RoboCup 2021 has to sent a participation intent. The details can be found under Qualification Criteria.The RoboCup 2021 will be consistent of two parts: A simulation based tournament, and a collection of four robot-based decentralized activities. To participate in the robot-based tournament, you need to have access to a field of at least 4x3m. The detailed rules for the robot-based tournament are still being drafted.There will not be different divisions in 2021. The robot-based tournament does not play normal matches, so divisions are not relevant there. In the virtual tournament, both teams have to agree on the used rules for each match. If no agreement is reached, the rules default to Division B.Due to the unusual circumstances regarding the qualification for Robocup 2021, the organizing committee might ask some more experienced teams to review some of the newly submitted TDPs, even if the reviewer are already qualified for the event.

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions by 16th of February 2021: 
Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).Submit a Team Video (see instructions below).
In addition, every team that intents on participating in the Robocup 2021 has to sent an participation intent, even if they were already qualified for the previous competition. A participation intent is an email to the organizing committee. The email subject should be 2021 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include: 
Team NameCountryUniversityMain contact name and emailWebsite (if you have one)Tournament you wish to participate in (simulation, robot based or both)
Please pay attention to the following points:
All teams qualified for Robocup 2020 are automatically qualified and do not have to submit a Team Description Paper or a Team Video.Communication will be made via e-mail, using the Small Size mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every division B team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) and every division A team an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The TDP should contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.The TDP should focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations should be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.The TDP should have a clear structure and it should be written in clear English.The TDP should be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions.
In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The ETDP should describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.The ETDP should be at least 6 pages long.
Submission Information
We have set up a conference management system to handle this years peer review process. It can be accessed at https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2020.
To create an account, click on “Register”, next to the “New to CMT?” text. To submit a paper, click on the top left button “Create a new submission”.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review other teams, and every team will receive three reviews for their (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage and be under 2 minutes long. The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):
A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup game or one of the local regional competitions. The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill.A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.
The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Teams have been asking us if they could show a video of a simulation due to current COVID restrictions. We want to make clear that teams need to have real working robots to participate in the SSL for 2021. If teams cannot satisfy the requirements for the team video, they can use a simulation, but it has to be video of your robots participating in a (simulated) match (item 1 in the list). Additionally, teams should show to the best of their capabilities that they do have real working robots. 
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:
Subject: 2021 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.The URL of your video, which must be available via FTP or HTTP.
Please pay attention to the following:
Please submit a single video file.The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

Team Poster

Every team must bring a poster to the RoboCup competition that illustrates the content of the (E)TDP. The poster is meant to be hung up in the venue for everyone to see and read. Technical details how this is going to happen in 2021 will be added here as soon they are available.

SOURCE: https://ssl.robocup.org/robocups/robocup-2009-technical-challenges/
CONTENT:
In 2009, we have two basic technical challenges, similar to 2008. These two basic challenges are intended to compare technical abilities needed for successfully playing robot soccer. Both are designed to be scalable, i.e. every team can participate almost without much special preparation. Of course, teams who spend extra time on preparing the challenge will probably benefit from their work. Please note that both of these two challenges have changed slightly from their respective 2008 versions.
Additionally to the two basic challenges, we have an enhanced Challenge for Mixed Team Play which will also involve the usage of the new SSL Shared Vision System.
Basic Challenge 1 – Shooting and Passing
Put up two to three robots on the field and score as many goals as possible within 120 seconds. Points are awarded as follows:
1 Point: Scoring a goal after two robots have touched the ball (i.e. after a pass)2 Points: Scoring a goal after the ball has been touched at least three times by alternating robots (i.e. after at least two passes)
The rules for this challenge:
To start, all robots must be placed within 1m from the own goal line.Opponent robots will be placed on the field as obstacles.A ball will be placed near one of the corners at the own side of the field.A goal can be scored only when the kicking robot is in the opponent’s half.Once a goal is scored or the ball has left the field, it will be placed again near one of the corners at the own side of the field.
Basic Challenge 2 – Navigation
Two sets of obstacles (all within 180mm diameter and marked with a standard blue or yellow center marker) are placed at each side of the field, at the approximate initial coordinates as shown in the attached sketch. One robot starts at the center of the field and must drive from one penalty mark of the field to the other as many times as possible within 120s. It must do so by alternating the side of entry between the two sets of obstacles, thus effectively driving a figure-eight. Every successful lap (from one set of obstacles to the other and back, while maintaining the figure-eight requirement) counts as one point. If it touches an obstacle, it gets a penalty of -1 points. Note, that the positions of the obstacles can change slightly during the execution of this challenge (e.g. by a robot bumping into them, or by a human repositioning them), so your system should accomodate for that.
Additionally, teams are allowed to use up to three robots in parallel and sum up their laps. If two robots touch each other, the penalty also applies (per touching event, not per robot, of course).
If a robot has driven at least one lap (independently of the number of collisions), the team’s minimum number of points will be 1.
The red line indicates an example trajectory of a robot performing this challenge.
Mixed Team Challenge
One of the aims of the Small Size League is to foster the development of cooperating agents. The current state of the art is to control all members of one team by a central intelligence instance which has a complete knowledge about the current state of each robot. Even in teams which have a distributed artificial intelligence component, every robot has detailed information about the behaviours of its team members and thus can deduce own actions which lead to an overall cooperative behaviour of the whole team. The aim of this challenge is to define a scenario for “real” cooperation, i.e. to let robots cooperate which do not have any knowledge about the internal state of all other robots of their team. This is intended to become realized by mixing existing teams which then have to accomplish a modified version of the “Shooting and Passing Challenge”.
Mixing Teams
First of all, a mixed team needs to be defined:
For the 2009 challenge, we consider a mixed team as a team of four robots originating from two different SSL teams. Each of these two sub-teams has to provide two robots. Every robot is controlled by its own software stack. Of course, all members of a mixed team have the same team marker colour. For this year, there will not be any communication between the different sub-teams. A mixed team must use the new SSL Shared Vision system.
As procedure for creating the mixed teams, the following approach will be applied:
Until June 17th (two weeks before the start of the competition), each team that is interested in participating in the challenge has to announce its interest to the OC. This is necessary for the preparation of the schedule.Every team that intends to participate in the mixed team challenge has to successfully participate in the “Shooting and Passing Challenge”, i.e. to score at least three points. This is necessary to assure a minimum level of passing skills.After the round robin stage of the soccer competition (i.e. on Friday afternoon), the teams for the “Mixed Team Challenge” become generated semi-randomly. Since there are several field assignment constraints for the finals (see section about “Time and Fields”) not every pair of teams is reasonable from an organizational point of view.
The Challenge
The task to accomplish is almost identical to the “Shooting and Passing Challenge”. Except the different number of robots (exactly four instead of up to three), the only difference is the scoring scheme: A pass will only be considering as valid if it has involved robots originating from two different teams.
Time and Fields
The challenge will be conducted during the two final days. Among the finals and the Humanoid Small Size demonstrations, there will be – especially on Sunday – enough free time slots. These slots will become assigned dynamically on site. There will be four SSL fields at the competition site. One of these fields will be used for Humanoid Small Size demonstrations during the weekend. Two others (on Sunday only one) are needed for official games. The remaining field can be used exclusively for the challenge. The two game fields can also be used (e.g. by those teams still participating in the competition) but only in a way that minimally disturbs the preparations for the official games.
Optional Game Demo
If some teams volunteer to show a mixed full 5 vs. 5 SSL soccer match, we would strongly appreciate and support this. Nevertheless, this will not be considered for the overall challenge ranking.
Overall Challenge Ranking
The results from the three challenges will be combined to get an overall technical challenge ranking.
To combine the challenge results, we will use the following formula:
Let BALL_SUM be the sum of all points that all teams received in the ball challenge and BALL_TEAM the number of points a single team received. Assume the same for the other two challenge (NAV_* and MIXED_* respectively).
Then TOTAL_TEAM = BALL_TEAM / BALL_SUM + NAV_TEAM / NAV_SUM + MIXED_TEAM / MIXED_SUM

Technical Challenges of the Small Size League are intended to encourage teams to develop solutions to specific problems that will advance the quality of gameplay within the league. Teams are evaluated for their completion of the challenge during a designated time at RoboCup each year.
Rules
Below are the rules for the different RoboCup 2024 technical challenges. Source code associated with these challenges can be found on GitHub.
Black and White Hulls Challenge
Since many teams currently use black as their main hull color, making it difficult to distinguish between the two teams during the game, this challenge aims to find a way to quickly change the hull color from black to white and back.

The following Open Source Submissions were made by the teams via email.
TIGERs Mannheim – AudioRef
Dear SSL-Community,
As in the past years we are very happy to announce our entry for the Open Source Award: The AudioRef!
https://github.com/TIGERs-Mannheim/AudioRef
The AudioRef aims to improve the understanding of the current game state for referees, participants and spectators in an intuitive and immediate way. To achieve this the AudioRef awaits state changes, card changes, command changes and new game events in game controller packets and uses configurable sound packs to trigger appropriate acoustic signals like whistle sounds or voice shouts. The currently available English and German sound packs have been designed with a specific focus on conciseness, using an intuitive whistle pattern and trying not to describe the obvious. You’re welcome to contribute your own sound packs!
The AudioRef has already been used at two local competitions and German Open 2024. You can hear it in action in this video from the German Open tournament (with the German sound pack): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgTJf4Soo_w
and very likely at the upcoming RoboCup!
In case you are missing any information or if you are just curious, contact us on Discord or write us an email.
Tigertastic Greetings,TIGERs Mannheim
ER-Force – Software Framework

Ri-one – Software Framework – RACOON-MW
Dear RoboCup SSL Teams,
Hello,
We are excited to submit our project “RACOON-MW” for this year’s Open Source Award.
Project Overview:SSL-RACOON-MW aggregates information from the Vision server and GameController and provides various useful information such as ball speed and robot speed together.For more details, please check out our GitHub repository:GitHub link: https://github.com/Rione/ssl-RACOON-MW
This software will be a perfect fit for new team: not only will it calculate your robot’s speed, slope, and intercept from Vision packets, but it will also identify your team and the opposing team using a game controller and a mode for simulators.These are then compiled and sent together in a single packet for your custom-made AI. This allows the team to focus on developing strategies!
We have included detailed usage instructions within the repository for your review. We hope this project will be beneficial to other teams as well.
If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.

Twente – TDP Search Engine V2
Dear RoboCuppers,
Once again, innovation and inspiration flows through the RoboCup. After last year’s successful Open Source competition with the Search Engine V1 , we’re ready to innovate once again! We would like to present the Search Engine V2! The project has received a complete overhaul. You can find it here https://tdpsearch.com/ . The new version supports the following additional features:

Ask ChatGPT directly through the Search Engine!
Papers from all leagues (over 600 and going up)
Improved search results with the help of AI (it’s magic)
Filter and search TDPs on leagues
Filter and search TDPs on year
It should not randomly break down anymore! (Thanks Azure)

Want to know how to onboard computer vision? BehRobot from the Humanoid Teen League already has figured this out. Is reinforcement learning useful? BadgerBots from the Soccer Standard Platform League can tell you. For robot-to-robot communication, ask Dagozilla from the Midsize League. And of course you can search through the latest papers from the SSL!
As a fun little extra, there is an image at the end of this mail containing a word cloud of the most used search terms up to now. If you want to know why Tigers is very much in there, here is a hint: “When in doubt, git clone Tigers” ~ Jorn, RoboTeam Twente
Best regards,
Emiel Steerneman – RoboTeam Twente

Immortals – AI software – Tyr
We are excited to submit our AI software, Tyr, for consideration in the open-source award category.
Tyr has been written from scratch for this year’s RoboCup, using parts of our old code with main focus on improving debug-ability and ease of development.
You can access the source code and documentation on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/Immortals-Robotics/Tyr

RobôCIn – Software Framework – ssl-core
Hi, everyone!
We are proud to announce ssl-core as our project submission for this year’s open-source competition. We hope it will contribute to the growth of our category at RoboCup.
ssl-core provides a framework for building distributed applications applied in the SSL environment that addresses the limitations of traditional monolithic software systems used in the category. The proposed approach is a microservice architecture that allows independent development and deployment in any technology, enhancing agility and reducing the risk of system-wide failures. 
To validate the system’s technologies, scope, and robustness, we developed the SSL VAR as an MVP of this repository aiming to use it in official competitions in the near future. SSL VAR provides real-time 3D visualization of the match (see figure below), as well as an analysis of past plays through replay at specific timestamps or events, such as fouls, penalties, or goals. 

To improve the separation of concerns within the system, the application’s GUI was detached from the core business logic handled by adopting a microfrontend architecture as a modern approach to building user interfaces. Thus, the microfrontend services can be separately deployed and accessed as a vision client, similar to the ssl-vision-client, but providing 3D visualization with the same functionalities as the complete proposed SSL VAR system.
Docker is the only dependency to run the SSL VAR.  To test in RoboCup, simply clone the repository and run:
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.robocup-2024-var.yaml up –build
For more information, visit our repository, we are always looking for enthusiastic contributors! Your contribution can make a big difference. Join our team and help us make the project even better! 
Best regards,
José Cruz, Matheus Teotonio, Uanderson Ricardo and Andresa Silva,
Software Infra Team, RobôCIn-INES.
luhbots soccer – Chipper with single coil for both chipping and kicking
Dear SSL Teams,
The luhbots soccer team is excited to submit our entry for the Open Source Award.
We present our innovative chipper, which utilizes a single coil for both chipping and kicking operations. This design offers several significant benefits:

Only one charge control circuit is required.
The simple design makes it easy for other teams to adopt.
It is an add-on to the original kicker, so no new design is needed. It can be adopted by teams currently limited to kicking.
Using a single, larger coil provides greater potential for design optimization.
Can be made entirely from 3D-printed parts.

You can find the repository with all design files here: https://github.com/luhsoccer/luhsoccer_chipper_2024Please feel free to reach out with any questions.
Best regards,Sebastian Knackstedtluhbots soccer

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions until the Team Qualification Material Submission Deadline, which is specified at the beginning of the page:

Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).
Submit a Team Video.
Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2024 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

Team Name
Country
University
Main contact name and email
Website (if you have one)
Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be made via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs must follow these guidelines:

The TDP must contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP must focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations must be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP must have a clear structure and it must be written in clear English.
The TDP must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions. Contrary to the requirements in the linked document the (E)TDP should also include page numbers.
The TDP must be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP must describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
Like last year we have set up a conference management system to handle the peer review process. It is accessible via this link: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2024
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existing account, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To create an account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. To submit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.
TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020 – This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardware improvements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also the reasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for other teams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier for reviewers to read it. It also has no overlaps with the team’s previous paper.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper – This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planning system. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significant changes in that area, and mentioning them would only mean having overlap with the previous paper. The size of the paper is also not excessively long.  
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020 – This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, the mechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It is a bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers each topic well and does not have overlap with the previous paper. 

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time. As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could be significantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. The qualification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old. If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams to prove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If your video is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match, teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (see listing below).  The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. For participating in Division A, teams also have to show their ball placement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2024 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in a modern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions by January 29th, 2019:
Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).Submit a Team Video.Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2019 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:Team NameCountryUniversityMain contact name and emailWebsite (if you have one)Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)Short rationale for the preferred division
Please pay attention to the following points:
Communication will be made via e-mail, using the Small Size mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The TDP should contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.The TDP should focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations should be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.The TDP should have a clear structure and it should be written in clear English.The TDP should be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions.
In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The ETDP should describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.The ETDP should be at least 6 pages long.To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.
Submission Information
We have set up a conference management system to handle this years peer review process. It can be accessed at http://conferences.cs.umass.edu/robocup-ssl-2019
Every team can register and upload their qualification materials to the site.
- Registration: Main page, select " I'm a new user and want to create an account"
- Submission: After logging in, click on "Start new paper" (https://conferences.cs.umass.edu/robocup-ssl-2019/paper/new)
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage. The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):
A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. The game should be based on contemporary rules (2011 and afterwards).A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.
The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:
Subject: 2019 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.The URL of your video, which must be available via FTP or HTTP.
Please pay attention to the following:
Please submit a single video file.The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

DOCUMENT 61
SOURCE: https://ssl.robocup.org/robocups/robocup-2011-technical-challenges/
CONTENT:
Two technical challenges and a demo will be held in Istanbul 2011.
These challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop technical contributions and to test ideas that can evolve the league towards the RoboCup goal of 2050. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint. Both are designed to be scalable, i.e. every team can participate, and the Committes urge all the competing teams to compete in the challenges. Please note that both of these two challenges have changed from their previous versions.
Until June 20th (two weeks before the start of the competition), teams interested in participating in the challenge need to announce its interest to the OC. This is necessary for the preparation of the schedule.
Dynamic Navigation Challenge
**This challenge was used at the Iran open, with slight differences
The aim of this technical challenge is examine the ability of robots to safely navigate in a dynamic environment.
As it is shown in the pictures, there are 6 robots acting as obstacles, two stationary and four moving along a straight line. The approximate positions and trajectories are depicted in the figures. The actual position may vary.
1.1) The maximum number of participating robots are limited to 3.
1.2) The participating robots must navigate between the two stationary obstacles as shown in pictures.
1.3) Whenever a robot touches an obstacle or its teammate it will receive a penalty (-1).
1.4) Each successful navigation cycle for each robot is scored (+1).
1.5) Robots who can perform the cycle carrying the ball score (+3).
1.6) The challenge time is 2 minutes.
Mixed Team Match Challenge
This is a full match between mixed teams, each composed of five robots originating from two different SSL teams. One of the SSL teams must provide three robots and the other must provide two. Each robot will be controlled by its originating SSL team own software stack.
2.3) Teams who want to participate in this challenge must confirm its intention to the OC until June 20th. The OC also urges teams who want to participate to try to adjust their software before the match.
2.1) All SSL rules will apply
2.2) The mixed team can swap which of the originating teams provides three and which provides two robots
2.3) After the round robin stage of the soccer competition the teams for the “Mixed Team Challenge” become generated semi-randomly
Large Field Demo
A mixed match, similar to the Mixed Team Match Challenge, between 6 to 8 robots on each side, where each SSL Team will provide half of the robots for the mixed team. The field of play will consist of two official SSL-Fields joined as one, with SSL-Vision operating with four cameras. The log files of the demo games will be available after the competition to all SSL teams, and will serve to foster the development of systems capable of using the large field.
D.1) Teams who want to participate in this challenge must confirm its intention to the OC until June 20th.
D.2) All rules of the Mixed Team Challenge apply.
D.3) Participation on this demo is conditioned to participation on the Mixed Team Challenge

CONTENT:
If your team is planning on joining the Small Size League (SSL), there are a few things you have to arrange. They are summarized on this page.
Communication
Our main means of communication is the Small Size League mailing list. The mailing list is the place to be for SSL-related announcements and discussion. We require that at least one person from every team be subscribed to this mailing list in order to receive important announcements. Once you are subscribed, you can post your own messages as well. Please be considerate of other subscribers’ time and energy and avoid posting unnecessarily. You can subscribe to the mailing list here.
Next to the mailing list, we have a Discord Server. Most team members are part of this server. This is where you can easily ask other teams for advice or help. Additionally, important league announcements are posted on this server. You can join the server here.
Qualification
To qualify for the SSL of RoboCup, you need to submit a team description paper and team video. Details regarding the qualification process, including important deadlines and divisions, can be found under the ‘RoboCup year’ tab on our website. For example, the qualification details for 2022 can be found here.
League-shared software
The league uses various software in order to play the matches. Some of them use team-specific parameters, which you will need to submit yourself by creating a pull request. This includes:

Adding your team logo to the status-board

Adding your exact team name to the game controller

Adding your robot height to ssl-vision

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions by February 1st, 2022:

Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).
Submit a Team Video.
Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2022 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

Team Name
Country
University
Main contact name and email
Website (if you have one)
Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be made via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The TDP should contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP should focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations should be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP should have a clear structure and it should be written in clear English.
The TDP should be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions.
The TDP should be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP should describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
We have to set up a conference management system to handle this year’s peer review process. It can be accessed at https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2022.
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existing account, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To create an account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. To submit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.
TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020 – This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardware improvements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also the reasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for other teams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier for reviewers to read it. It also has no overlaps with the team’s previous paper.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper – This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planning system. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significant changes in that area, and mentioning them would only mean having overlap with the previous paper. The size of the paper is also not excessively long.  
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020 – This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, the mechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It is a bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers each topic well and does not have overlap with the previous paper. 

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time. As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could be significantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. The qualification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old. Due to the COVID pandemic we allow to use a video from 2019, especially from participating in RoboCup Sydney, too. If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams to prove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If your video is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match, teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (see listing below).  The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. For participating in Division A, teams also have to show their ball placement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2022 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in a modern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP.Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams thatpresent substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCuptournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs must follow these guidelines:

The TDP must contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP must focus on innovations that the team has produced withrespect to their previous TDPs. These innovations must be described indetail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP must have a clear structure and it must be written in clear English.
The TDP must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions. Contrary to the requirements in the linked document the (E)TDP should also include page numbers.
The TDP must be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long. This does not include references.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP must describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team mustbring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. Theposter must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will behung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
Like last year we have set up a conference management system to handle the peer review process. It is accessible via this link: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2025
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existingaccount, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To createan account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. Tosubmit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Qualification Process

After the Team Qualification Material Submission Deadline, the OC will reach out by email to all teams that submitted the three required materials for qualification (video, participation intent, (E)TDP). This starts the single-blind peer-review phase: Each team is assigned three (E)TDPs and is tasked to review them, answer basic questions about the submissions and share concerns and ideas for improvement with the team and/or the TC/OC.
To keep the review single-blind, please avoid self-identifying yourself or your team in the comments or shared media. The single-blind review is important to us because it allows reviewers to share their concerns or criticize the submission without fear for retaliation.Failure to meaningfully review the submissions may result in disqualification of your team!
After the TDP Peer Review Deadline but on or before the Preliminary Team Qualification Results Announcement, TC/OC will contact each team (again, by email) to announce to them one of the following four Preliminary Qualification Status:

Qualified: If the video and the (E)TDP are of sufficient quality, a team is directly qualified for the RoboCup. They are still encouraged to improve their (E)TDP by incorporating relevant feedback, but this isn’t required to participate. Teams can (in extreme cases) lose their qualified status – by prolonged failure to reply to OCs emails that are crucial for running the competition. Qualified teams can withdraw for any reason from the competition by announcing their withdrawal to the OC. Teams are encouraged to announce their withdrawal as soon as they know to allow for teams to move up from the waiting list (and to allow for a smooth organization).
On the waiting list: We have to limit the number of participants for the RoboCup. If the number of applicants is higher than our capacity, we give out slots based on initial qualification material quality (with a higher significance on (E)TDP quality), and a few slots are given out by chance. Teams who have otherwise qualified, but who haven’t managed to get a slot are on the waiting list. In their email announcing this to the team, TC/OC includes the current position on the waiting list (ranked by qualification material quality). If a qualified team withdraws, TC/OC will go through the waiting list in order and search for a replacement team. Keep an eye on your emails! If you are on the waiting list and want to withdraw, please also announce that to the OC to speed up the process.
Conditionally Qualified: If the video and/or the (E)TDP have major flaws, teams are usually conditionally qualified. In their email announcing this decision, TC/OC gives a list of conditions the team has to meet by the Final TDP Submission Deadline to be allowed to compete in the RoboCup. Failure to do so will result in disqualification.
Not qualified: In extremely rare cases (with a unanimous vote in TC/OC) a bad (E)TDP submission can result in the team being not qualified, without a second chance to improve their submission. This is only for extreme cases, and reflects that conditional qualification is a huge drain on scarce resources: While your initial (E)TDP was reviewed by three of your peers, checking your updated (E)TDP after a conditional qualification has to be done by TC/OC members. Initially submitting an (E)TDP that clearly isn’t even close to be acceptable for qualification and planning on writing a decent one only for the final (E)TDP Submission Deadline is disrespectful towards your peers who had to waste time on a review you are not interested in, and is requiring the TC/OC to do a full review of your submission themselves.

TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020– This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardwareimprovements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also thereasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for otherteams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier forreviewers to read it. It also has no (self-)plagiarism.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper– This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planningsystem. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significantchanges in that area, and mentioning them would only mean havingduplicate information. The paper is also notexcessively long.
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020– This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, themechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It isa bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers eachtopic well and it has no (self-)plagiarism.
 
Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time.As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could resultsignificantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. Thequalification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old.If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams toprove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If yourvideo is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match,teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (seelisting below). The qualification video can be either of the followingtypes, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game(i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). Thevideo should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. Forparticipating in Division A, teams also have to show their ballplacement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a teamto compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams inthe qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
 
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2025 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in amodern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

Dear SSL community,
as in past years, we are happy to submit our entry for the Open SourceAward.
You will find a list of our publications below.
Framework + Simulator:
This is the main software we use to develop and test our AI. It is able to– receive and process real life vision data– simulate SSL games– control robots– create game recordings and play them back…and much more.
New features since last years RoboCup include:– A new dribbling filter– Basic Git integration (i.e. show the Commit the binary is built from)Git integration into our log format will be released soon afterRoboCup– Various bug fixes and small features
The repository also contains our simulator, bundled as a standaloneexecutable for usage in this years RoboCup.
https://github.com/robotics-erlangen/framework
Autoref
This is our automatic referee, that detects the various ruleinfringements teams can commit during a SSL game.
https://github.com/robotics-erlangen/autoref
In case you have questions about our software or are just curious, feelwelcome to write an email to info@robotics-erlangen.de
Best regardsPaul BergmannER-Force
RoboTeam Twente
Dear SSL-Community,
For the first year since competing RoboTeam Twente is ready to enter for the Open Source Award. As all of our team members change (almost) in full every year we strive to have detailed and easy to understand documentation for everyone. This means that apart from all our designs we have collected all our recent how-to’s, design decisions and detailed explanations into a wiki. This wiki we also use to introduce new people to our team, so we hope it can be especially helpful for newer teams and those who are looking into tips for building enough robots to transition to division A.
Our wiki can be found here: https://wiki.roboteamtwente.nl/
Although the wiki also describes all previously made design in terms of hardware and software, some highlights of the changes we made this year include:
– Transitioning to a modular design with hardware and electronics combined for faster repair and more extensive testing. (rationale)- A fully renewed Front Assembly, which contains our dribbler and a new dampening mechanism. (design | rationale)– Custom made space-saving solenoids for kicking and chipping which freed up quite some space in our robots. (design | rationale)– Newly designed path planning based on bang-bang trajectories. (rationale)
We hope this can help other teams in their process of improving the SSL robots. If you have any questions we are more than happy to answer them, and if you find it useful we would love to hear that from you. We look forward to seeing you all at the RoboCup!
Kind regards,
Anne van Harten | RoboTeam Twente
RoboFEI
Dear SSL community,
Since the end of 2020, we have been releasing a good number of repositories as open source software. We are doing it for two main reasons.
Firstly, we believe on the give-a-penny-take-a-penny concept. Based on this principle, since we are daily using lots of open source software developed by the Small Size League Community, we should also share our software in a sign of gratitude, in a way of contributing to the community that have always supported us.
Secondly, we believe that sharing software is important for educational purposes, we have learned a lot from open source software (like how to rewrite and reuse a piece of software) and we hope that, releasing our software to the public, we can help others in that way too. Sharing software is equivalent to sharing knowledge, which is beneficial for everyone.
Below you will find our repositories.
Software (SSL-Strategy)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy>
Languages: C++ (almost 99% of the source code); Python; QMake
This is the software that we use during RoboCup matches. Its main purpose is to control one team during a Small Size League game. The GUI is highly customizable (with options like selecting number of defenders and offenders, the maximum speed of the robots, the maximum strength of a kick and so on). It has a nice graphical client for visualizing the field and some options, like the interaction with the simulator.
To improve the quality and usefulness of our open-source material we’ve started slowly changing our code base from portuguese to english. Although it demands a great effort to translate all the previous code, we believe that this should greatly improve the accessibility of our code base to the league.
Software (LogAnalyserRoboFEI-SSL)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/LogAnalyserRoboFei-SSL>
Languages: C++; QMake
This software is based on the Robocup Small Size League C++ Log Tools (https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-logtools) and on the RoboFEI Small Size League Main Software (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy).
It provides a simple log player combined with a graphical client can that read vision and referee messages (from the network or directly from the log player). Furthermore it provides more options for loading and playing a match log file; for example, it is possible to ignore the match states when the game is stopped or halted and consider the other states. The Kalman filter from our main software is also embedded with the application.
At last, the Enable Analysis option activates a feature that can check when a shoot move or pass move occurs and it in a 0 to 250 scale. At the end of the game, the software generates the information of all moves occurred on the match.
We are working on an implementation that provides a game statistics viewer tool that shows statistics of the game (like the ball possession, the amount of passes and pass precision, shoots to goal and so on), but it is still in development.
Software (JoystickRobotController):
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/joystickrobotcontroller>
Languages:C++; QMake
The objective of this software is to easily test the RoboFEI robots – verifying if the robots wheels, kick sensor, dribbler, and other components are working properly. It makes it possible to control the robot, either with a joystick controller or with a computer keyboard.
Sincerely,
The RoboFEI team.
TIGERs Mannheim
Dear SSL-community,
as in the past years we are very happy to announce our entry for theOpen Source Award. By now there is a one-stop shop to get it all:https://github.com/TIGERs-MannheimWe are doing a complete and full release of everything we have,including electronics, mechanics, and our full AI. Here is a briefdescription of what has changed.
Mechanics:The kicker and dribbler have been slightly updated to be more robust.The dribbler now allows prolonged periods of dribbling with highertorque. The release includes the full robot mechanics.
Firmware:The build system has been changed to CMake and the folder structure hasbeen reorganized. The dribbler control algorithm now allows bettercurrent and speed control. Test and model identification methods havebeen cleaned up and improved. The release also includes our wirelessprotocol and base station firmware.
Software (AI):The heart and brain of our team, the central control software “Sumatra”.Of course, compatible with the simulation protocol. So you can test yourAI against ours locally. Watch out for some serious dribbling moveswhich will make you sweat 😉
In case you are missing any information or if you are just curios,contact us on Discord or write us an email.
Tigertastic Greetings,TIGERs Mannheim

CONTENT:
Technical Challenges of the Small Size League are intended to encourage teams to develop solutions to specific problems that will advance the quality of gameplay within the league. Teams are evaluated for their completion of the challenge during a designated time at RoboCup each year.
Rules
Below are the rules for the different RoboCup 2024 technical challenges. Source code associated with these challenges can be found on GitHub.
Black and White Hulls Challenge
Since many teams currently use black as their main hull color, making it difficult to distinguish between the two teams during the game, this challenge aims to find a way to quickly change the hull color from black to white and back.
Black and White Hulls Challenge Rules (HTML)Black and White Hulls Challenge Rules (PDF)
Team vs Team Passing Challenge
This challenge is similar to the Chip Pass Challenge from 2023 and the Pass endurance Hardware Challenge from 2021, with the added twist that two teams compete against each other trying to complete as many passes as possible.

The following Open Source Submissions were made by the teams via email.
TIGERs Mannheim – AudioRef
Dear SSL-Community,
As in the past years we are very happy to announce our entry for the Open Source Award: The AudioRef!
https://github.com/TIGERs-Mannheim/AudioRef
The AudioRef aims to improve the understanding of the current game state for referees, participants and spectators in an intuitive and immediate way. To achieve this the AudioRef awaits state changes, card changes, command changes and new game events in game controller packets and uses configurable sound packs to trigger appropriate acoustic signals like whistle sounds or voice shouts. The currently available English and German sound packs have been designed with a specific focus on conciseness, using an intuitive whistle pattern and trying not to describe the obvious. You’re welcome to contribute your own sound packs!
The AudioRef has already been used at two local competitions and German Open 2024. You can hear it in action in this video from the German Open tournament (with the German sound pack): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgTJf4Soo_w
and very likely at the upcoming RoboCup!
In case you are missing any information or if you are just curious, contact us on Discord or write us an email.
Tigertastic Greetings,TIGERs Mannheim
ER-Force – Software Framework
Hello everyone,
ER-Force’s submission for this year’s Open Source Award is our framework (https://github.com/robotics-erlangen/framework). This is the main software we use to develop and test our AI.
It is able to

receive and process real life vision data
simulate SSL games in a full physics simulation
control robots
create game recordings and play them back
run strategies written in Lua and TypeScript
…and much more.

Best regards,
Christoph Schmidtmeier, ER-Force
Ri-one – Software Framework – RACOON-MW
Dear RoboCup SSL Teams,
Hello,
We are excited to submit our project “RACOON-MW” for this year’s Open Source Award.
Project Overview:SSL-RACOON-MW aggregates information from the Vision server and GameController and provides various useful information such as ball speed and robot speed together.For more details, please check out our GitHub repository:GitHub link: https://github.com/Rione/ssl-RACOON-MW
This software will be a perfect fit for new team: not only will it calculate your robot’s speed, slope, and intercept from Vision packets, but it will also identify your team and the opposing team using a game controller and a mode for simulators.These are then compiled and sent together in a single packet for your custom-made AI. This allows the team to focus on developing strategies!
We have included detailed usage instructions within the repository for your review. We hope this project will be beneficial to other teams as well.
If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.
Best regards,

Twente – TDP Search Engine V2
Dear RoboCuppers,
Once again, innovation and inspiration flows through the RoboCup. After last year’s successful Open Source competition with the Search Engine V1 , we’re ready to innovate once again! We would like to present the Search Engine V2! The project has received a complete overhaul. You can find it here https://tdpsearch.com/ . The new version supports the following additional features:

Ask ChatGPT directly through the Search Engine!
Papers from all leagues (over 600 and going up)
Improved search results with the help of AI (it’s magic)
Filter and search TDPs on leagues
Filter and search TDPs on year
It should not randomly break down anymore! (Thanks Azure)

Want to know how to onboard computer vision? BehRobot from the Humanoid Teen League already has figured this out. Is reinforcement learning useful? BadgerBots from the Soccer Standard Platform League can tell you. For robot-to-robot communication, ask Dagozilla from the Midsize League. And of course you can search through the latest papers from the SSL!
As a fun little extra, there is an image at the end of this mail containing a word cloud of the most used search terms up to now. If you want to know why Tigers is very much in there, here is a hint: “When in doubt, git clone Tigers” ~ Jorn, RoboTeam Twente
Best regards,
Emiel Steerneman – RoboTeam Twente

Immortals – AI software – Tyr
We are excited to submit our AI software, Tyr, for consideration in the open-source award category.
Tyr has been written from scratch for this year’s RoboCup, using parts of our old code with main focus on improving debug-ability and ease of development.
You can access the source code and documentation on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/Immortals-Robotics/Tyr
Best regards,
Ali Salehi,
On behalf of Immortals
RobôCIn – Software Framework – ssl-core
Hi, everyone!
We are proud to announce ssl-core as our project submission for this year’s open-source competition. We hope it will contribute to the growth of our category at RoboCup.
ssl-core provides a framework for building distributed applications applied in the SSL environment that addresses the limitations of traditional monolithic software systems used in the category. The proposed approach is a microservice architecture that allows independent development and deployment in any technology, enhancing agility and reducing the risk of system-wide failures. 
To validate the system’s technologies, scope, and robustness, we developed the SSL VAR as an MVP of this repository aiming to use it in official competitions in the near future. SSL VAR provides real-time 3D visualization of the match (see figure below), as well as an analysis of past plays through replay at specific timestamps or events, such as fouls, penalties, or goals. 

To improve the separation of concerns within the system, the application’s GUI was detached from the core business logic handled by adopting a microfrontend architecture as a modern approach to building user interfaces. Thus, the microfrontend services can be separately deployed and accessed as a vision client, similar to the ssl-vision-client, but providing 3D visualization with the same functionalities as the complete proposed SSL VAR system.
Docker is the only dependency to run the SSL VAR.  To test in RoboCup, simply clone the repository and run:
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.robocup-2024-var.yaml up –build
For more information, visit our repository, we are always looking for enthusiastic contributors! Your contribution can make a big difference. Join our team and help us make the project even better! 
Best regards,
José Cruz, Matheus Teotonio, Uanderson Ricardo and Andresa Silva,
Software Infra Team, RobôCIn-INES.
luhbots soccer – Chipper with single coil for both chipping and kicking
Dear SSL Teams,
The luhbots soccer team is excited to submit our entry for the Open Source Award.
We present our innovative chipper, which utilizes a single coil for both chipping and kicking operations. This design offers several significant benefits:

Only one charge control circuit is required.
The simple design makes it easy for other teams to adopt.
It is an add-on to the original kicker, so no new design is needed. It can be adopted by teams currently limited to kicking.
Using a single, larger coil provides greater potential for design optimization.
Can be made entirely from 3D-printed parts.

You can find the repository with all design files here: https://github.com/luhsoccer/luhsoccer_chipper_2024Please feel free to reach out with any questions.
Best regards,Sebastian Knackstedtluhbots soccer

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions until the Team Qualification Material Submission Deadline, which is specified at the beginning of the page:

Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).
Submit a Team Video.
Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2024 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

Team Name
Country
University
Main contact name and email
Website (if you have one)
Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be made via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs must follow these guidelines:

The TDP must contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP must focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations must be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP must have a clear structure and it must be written in clear English.
The TDP must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions. Contrary to the requirements in the linked document the (E)TDP should also include page numbers.
The TDP must be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP must describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
Like last year we have set up a conference management system to handle the peer review process. It is accessible via this link: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2024
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existing account, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To create an account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. To submit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.
TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020 – This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardware improvements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also the reasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for other teams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier for reviewers to read it. It also has no overlaps with the team’s previous paper.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper – This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planning system. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significant changes in that area, and mentioning them would only mean having overlap with the previous paper. The size of the paper is also not excessively long.  
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020 – This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, the mechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It is a bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers each topic well and does not have overlap with the previous paper. 

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time. As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could be significantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. The qualification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old. If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams to prove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If your video is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match, teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (see listing below).  The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. For participating in Division A, teams also have to show their ball placement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2024 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in a modern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

Chip Kick Interception

The goal of this challenge is to detect and intercept chip kicks based on SSL Vision data.

Procedure
A chip kick is performed from 3 different locations by an opponent robot:

 From a corner to the center of the field From a corner along the long side of the field From the goal to the center
At each location, 4 kicks of different distances are performed.
These distances are 2m, 2.5m, 3m and 3.5m in random order.

A participating team places one robot on the field. The task is to touch the ball
before or shortly after it hits the ground for the first time. This shall imitate the defense problem when the opponent
plays chip kicks.

A participating team has to publish its software which is responsible for detecting chip kicks
and reconstructing the flight trajectory.

Score
Each successfull interception (i.e. the participating robot touches the ball before it hits the ground a second time) gives 3 points. If the ball is kicked instead of simply touched, 1 extra point will be awarded. If the ball is kicked into a goal, 1 further extra point will be awarded. This gives a total number of 60 possible points. 

Multi-Team Communication

The purpose of this challenge is an implementation demonstration of the SSL multi-team communication protocol.
Therefore, two participating teams perform various collaborative tasks using this protocol.
The mixed team has 15 seconds to accomplish each task.
This challenge assumes a simple master-slave relationship between the two collaborating teams.
This is, the master team sends a team plan to the slave team, which acts according to this plan.
In order to evaluate the behavior in accordance to the team plan, the master team
sends the team plan to an evaluator computer (run by the TC). This computer forwards
the team plan to the slave team.

Initial situation for each task
The referee command before the actual tasks is Stop. The robots of both teams
have to be located within 1 meter distance to the middle line between the two goals.
The goalie has to be located in the defense are and has to remain there during all tasks.

Task 1
This task
 is signaled by a GameForce referee command.
All defenders have to move to the own goal, all attackers to the 
opponent goal. Every robot of the joint team except for the goalie
must be assigned either a Defense or Offense RobotRole.
There have to be at least 2 defenders and 2 attackers.
The task is fulfilled when all robots are located within 2 meter 
distance to the particular goal’s center, but not inside the defense or 
attack area.

Task 2
This task is signaled by an Indirect Freekick command for the opponent team (which
is not present at the field).

9 defenders have to be located with less than 10 centimeters distance to the defense area, but
not occupying or touching the defense area. The master team should prescribe the target positions
in order to avoid positioning conflicts.

Task 3
This task is signaled by an Indirect Freekick command for the mixed team.

The master team chooses one of the partner team’s robots and 
plays a pass to this robot. The task is fulfilled
if no other than this robot and the kicker of the freekick touched the 
ball
before it entered the opponent’s goal. The chosen robot of the Slave 
team is indicated
by sending a shot_target to this (and only this) robot in its RobotPlan.
If the ball leaves the field without scoring a goal, or if another robot
 than the two mentioned touched the ball, no points are scored.

Score
Each 
successfully accomplished task gives an 5 points, remaining seconds are 
added up as points. Both teams receive the same amount of points.
This gives a total number of 60 possible points.

The best 4 scoring teams will be qualified to compete in the Mixed Team Challenge.

RoboCup 2020/2021

Due to the circumstances in January 2021, RoboCup 2021 will be a fully virtual / decentralized event. All teams, even already qualified teams via the Qualification for RoboCup 2020 are advised to read the following point carefully.
Evey team intending on participating in RoboCup 2021 has to sent a participation intent. The details can be found under Qualification Criteria.The RoboCup 2021 will be consistent of two parts: A simulation based tournament, and a collection of four robot-based decentralized activities. To participate in the robot-based tournament, you need to have access to a field of at least 4x3m. The detailed rules for the robot-based tournament are still being drafted.There will not be different divisions in 2021. The robot-based tournament does not play normal matches, so divisions are not relevant there. In the virtual tournament, both teams have to agree on the used rules for each match. If no agreement is reached, the rules default to Division B.Due to the unusual circumstances regarding the qualification for Robocup 2021, the organizing committee might ask some more experienced teams to review some of the newly submitted TDPs, even if the reviewer are already qualified for the event.

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions by 16th of February 2021: 
Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).Submit a Team Video (see instructions below).
In addition, every team that intents on participating in the Robocup 2021 has to sent an participation intent, even if they were already qualified for the previous competition. A participation intent is an email to the organizing committee. The email subject should be 2021 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include: 
Team NameCountryUniversityMain contact name and emailWebsite (if you have one)Tournament you wish to participate in (simulation, robot based or both)
Please pay attention to the following points:
All teams qualified for Robocup 2020 are automatically qualified and do not have to submit a Team Description Paper or a Team Video.Communication will be made via e-mail, using the Small Size mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every division B team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) and every division A team an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The TDP should contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.The TDP should focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations should be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.The TDP should have a clear structure and it should be written in clear English.The TDP should be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions.
In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The ETDP should describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.The ETDP should be at least 6 pages long.
Submission Information
We have set up a conference management system to handle this years peer review process. It can be accessed at https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2020.
To create an account, click on “Register”, next to the “New to CMT?” text. To submit a paper, click on the top left button “Create a new submission”.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review other teams, and every team will receive three reviews for their (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage and be under 2 minutes long. The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):
A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup game or one of the local regional competitions. The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill.A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.
The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Teams have been asking us if they could show a video of a simulation due to current COVID restrictions. We want to make clear that teams need to have real working robots to participate in the SSL for 2021. If teams cannot satisfy the requirements for the team video, they can use a simulation, but it has to be video of your robots participating in a (simulated) match (item 1 in the list). Additionally, teams should show to the best of their capabilities that they do have real working robots. 
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:
Subject: 2021 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.The URL of your video, which must be available via FTP or HTTP.
Please pay attention to the following:
Please submit a single video file.The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

Team Poster

Every team must bring a poster to the RoboCup competition that illustrates the content of the (E)TDP. The poster is meant to be hung up in the venue for everyone to see and read. Technical details how this is going to happen in 2021 will be added here as soon they are available.

CONTENT:
At RoboCup 2021 there will be a virtual tournament without any hardware involved. It will be played with the latest rule set, except that division A and division B teams will play in the same tournament. If one of the playing teams wishes to play with division B rules, the match will be played with division B rules.
The infrastructure for this tournament will be provided by the RoboCup organizers. Teams are expected to run their software on a Linux system, likely minimal Ubuntu 20.04 inside a custom Docker container.
The setup and configuration for the competition is available on Github, so every team can test it beforehand.
The tournament is hosted at https://virtual.ssl.robocup.org/
Procedure
The primary referee will control the game and should start preparing the next match at least 5 min before the scheduled start time. If the primary refereeing team does not show up 5 minutes before the scheduled start time, the secondary refereeing team will take over the role of the primary referee and the GC operator.
If a team does not show up within 10 minutes after the scheduled starting time or if one team forfeits, the other team will play on an empty goal in the group stage and will automatically win in the elimination stage.
Before each match
Initialize the game-controller
Start a new game.Enter the correct team names.Make sure that both autoRefs are connected.Make sure that all game events for both autoRefs are set to Accept.Make sure that all game events for GC are set to Majority.
Retrieve information from both teams
The Match Preparation from the rules apply, expect for the following differences:
Determine one main contact person per team (which takes the role of the robot handler and is the only one allowed to talk with the referee)Ask teams if both agree to play with DivA rules, else switch to DivB in GC.Determine team colors (like described in the rules)Determine which team will have the first kickoff (by flipping a (virtual) coin) and enter it into the GC.Ask teams for their initial keeper ids and set the id in the GC.
Start the game at the scheduled start time or soon after, when all teams are ready
Ask if teams are ready.Hit STOP in the GC.The match should automatically start with a kickoff as soon as all robots are at valid positions.
After the match
Make sure that the game is switched to the “end of game” stage at the top. This will stop the automatic recording.Submit the results to https://scheduling.virtual.ssl.robocup.org/results.

CONTENT:
A key distinguishing characteristic of the Small Size League is its tight integration of software and hardware, which is crucial to success. A purely simulated tournament may reflect the best in software, but it excludes hardware development and omits hardware-software integration. To address this gap, the SSL hardware challenges will be conducted alongside the virtual SSL soccer tournament for RoboCup 2021. The rules for the SSL Hardware Challenges require significantly fewer resources than a full-size SSL field setup, and takes into account the constraints identified by the SSL teams.
The rules of the hardware challenges are available in both HTML format optimized for viewing on electronic devices and as a PDF for printing:

Dear SSL community,
Since the end of 2020, we have been releasing a good number of repositories as open source software. We are doing it for two main reasons.
Firstly, we believe on the give-a-penny-take-a-pennyconcept. Based on this principle, since we are daily using lots of open source software developed by the Small Size League Community, we should also share our software in a sign of gratitude, in a way of contributing to the community have always supported us.
Secondly, we believe that sharing software is important for educational purposes, we have learned a lot from open source software (like how to rewrite and reuse a piece of software) and we hope that, releasing our software to the public, we can help others in that way too. Sharing software is equivalent to sharing knowledge, which is beneficial for everyone.
Below you will find our publications on the last year:
Software (SSL-Strategy)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy>
Languages:C++ (almost 99% of the source code); Python; QMake
This is the software that we use during RoboCup matches. Its main purpose is to control one team during a Small Size League game. The GUI is highly customizable (with options like selecting number of defenders and offenders, the maximum speed of the robots, the maximum strength of a kick and so on). It has a nice graphical client for visualizing the field and some options, like the interaction with the simulator.
The source code and the interface are all in Brazilian Portuguese idiom, so it might be difficult to use it for non-Portuguese speakers. Nevertheless, we are planning to add an English translation to the software; that way, the GUI could be used in both, English and Portuguese languages.
Software (LogAnalyserRoboFEI-SSL)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/LogAnalyserRoboFei-SSL>
Languages:C++; QMake
This software is based on the Robocup Small Size League C++ Log Tools (https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-logtools) and on the RoboFEI Small Size League Main Software (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy).
It provides a simple log player combined with a graphical client can that read vision and referee messages (from the network or directly from the log player). Furthermore it provides more options for loading and playing a match log file; for example, it is possible to ignore the match states when the game is stopped or halted and consider the other states. The Kalman filter from our main software is also embedded with the application.
Other additional functionalities like, download the Match League Log Files directly from the software and the use of predefined shortcuts provides an easy environment for the user watch Small Size League matches recorded or in real time.
At last, the Enable Analysis option activates a feature that can check when a shoot move or pass move occurs and evaluates this move in a 0 to 250 scale. At the end, a file is generated with the results. We are working on an implementation that provides a game statistics viewer tool that shows statistics of the game (like the ball possession, the amount of passes and pass precision, shoots to goal and so on), but it is still in development.
Software (JoystickRobotController):
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/joystickrobotcontroller>
Languages:C++; QMake
The objective of this software is to easily test the RoboFEI robots – verifying if the robots wheels, kick sensor, dribbler, and other components are working properly. It makes it possible to control the robot, either with a joystick controller or with a computer keyboard.
Sincerely,
The RoboFEI team.

DOCUMENT 102
SOURCE: https://ssl.robocup.org/robocups/robocup-2012-technical-challenges/
CONTENT:
Two technical challenges and the Mixed team tournament will be held this year.
These challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop technical contributions and to test ideas that can evolve the league towards the RoboCup goal of 2050. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint, and the Committes encourages all the participating teams to compete in the challenges.
Until April 25th, teams interested in participating in any of the challenges or in the Mixed team tournament need to announce their interest to the Organizing Committee . This is necessary for the preparation of the schedules.
Passing and Shooting Challenge
To test the ability of coordinated passing and motion of the teams, in an environment with moving obstacles, the following challenge is proposed: Up to four robots, placed within areas on each side the field, must pass and receive the ball across four moving obstacles, repositioning themselves according to the sequence shown in the figure below and, at the end, score the goal.
Rules
Every received pass scores +1, and every intercepted or missed pass scores -1;There’s a bonus of +3 for scoring the goal;If the ball is intercepted, stops or goes out of bounds, it will be placed on the start position;The moving obstacles will travel at 1m/s speed, with slight variation allowed;The location of the obstacle robots will follow the figure, however their exact position may vary slightly;Robots cannot leave the areas of the field designated for them;Chip kicks are not permitted; – item added as Rule Clarification (June 7th)The size of each passing area is 1.25m x 6.1m, measured from the bounds of the field;Teams have 2 minutes to complete the challenge;Wins the team with higher score.
Pass/Intercept Challenge
Attention: This challenge’s format has changed on April 10th
This challenge tests both the ability to pass the ball in a reduced space, with adversaries, and the ability to intercept the ball when defending. The challenge occurs between two teams, on a half of the field. One of the teams, with up to four robots, tries to pass the ball as many times as possible, while the other team uses two robots to try to intercept the passes. Robots are free to move anywhere, as long as they respect the minimum distance between them, as shown on the picture below. The two teams swap passing and defending roles at the half-time interval.
Rules
Every received pass scores +2 and every intercepted or missed pass scores -1;If the ball is intercepted, goes out of bounds or stops, a referee halt signal will be sent and the ball placed again around the goal kick position;Passing robots must keep minimum distance of 1m between teammates for passing score to be accounted;Defending robots must keep minimum distance of 0.5m from the robot holding the ball;Referee can penalize with -1 each offense to the minimum distance rules;Matches will consist of 2 periods of 2 minutes, with approx. 30 seconds interval between;Team with higher score wins;The challenge will follow eliminatory match style. Brackets will be drawn on the day of the competition.
Mixed Team Tournament
This is a full match between mixed teams, each composed of six robots originating from two different SSL teams. Each robot will be controlled by its originating SSL team software. However, communication between the teams is allowed, as long as there is no direct control of the robots. The tournament format will let teams play matches as members of different mixed teams.
* The exact number of matches and schedule will be announced by the OC after the team confirmation deadline.
Rules
Both teams forming the mixed team must have the same number of robots on the field at the beginning of a match;All SSL rules will apply;Goals are only valid if robots from the two forming teams have touched the ball since the last game stoppage;The mixed teams will be formed by seeding.The winner is based off two round robins, a preliminary and a final one with advanced teams.

Hi, everyone!
We are proud to announce a series of repositories that we plan to submit at this year’s open-source. Hopefully they will help grow our category here at RoboCup.
RobôCIn’s Plans for Future Software Development

project-unification: https://github.com/robocin/project-unification
This project aims to demonstrate the use of the soccer-common framework (https://github.com/robocin/soccer-common), developed by RobôCIn and used in the RoboCup SSL and IEEE VSS categories. Also, the repository serves as a starting point to the team’s new developers and teams that want to start strategies on SSL.
Usage examples:

caiomvfc: https://github.com/caiovmfc/Seletiva-RoboCin-VSS-cvmfc

robocin-cpp: https://github.com/robocin/robocin-cpp

It is a library heavily inspired by abseil owned by Google, and seeks to extract what worked well from soccer-common, implementing software engineering best practices and modern C++ with a README-by-folder based documentation. It provides the core library for our next team’s robotics applications.

Floating-point comparison;
Angular/geometric operations;
In the long term it will be like libsrc in 2D for our team.

protocols: https://github.com/robocin/protocols
The protobufs used by the competition are widely dispersed in the repositories that require them, making it necessary to copy and paste the files that are currently being used in the category. Thus, the protocols used are highly duplicated in the RoboCup SSL softwares, but also in the team’s strategy softwares.
In this context, we propose a single repository containing the protocols used by as well as installation guidelines for various programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, etc.
robocin-ines: https://github.com/joseviccruz/robocin-ines, https://github.com/uandersonricardo/robocin-ines-server, https://github.com/uandersonricardo/robocin-ines-webui
robocin-ines provides a base framework for architecting robotic applications. This set of repositories comes as an optimization of our current software (ssl-unification), providing a microservices-based framework which:

Enables the use of different programming languages;
Uses the ZeroMQ framework to communicate services with latency below 1ms;
Defines a visualization on the Web, providing better development simplicity;

However, this final structure is not yet finalized and, as a way to validate the technologies, scope, and robustness of the system, the SSL VAR was developed as an MVP of this repository.
SSL VAR is a match recording system, which allows the viewing of the match in real time, as well as the analysis of past plays through replay at a given timestamp or according to a given event in the match, such as a foul, penalty, or goal. In this way, it allows the human referee to analyze a past play and check whether his decision and also the decisions of the automatic referees were correct or not.
The ultimate goal of this repository is to provide a base structure for organizing new SSL teams using microservices, and to extend the life and maintenance of our current software.Best regards, RobôCIn.
RoboFEI
Dear SSL community,
RoboFEI would like to submit our hardware and software works for the open-source award. We are happy to say that we have released all the mechanics, electronics, AI, and firmware for this year.
Regarding mechanics, the new robot’s generation is fully released on our GitLab (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/ssl-mechanics). The project aims for modularization that will help robot maintenance and assembly.
In electronics, both the main and kick boards have been changed aiming for modularization, besides the fact that the team replaced the FPGA with an STM microcontroller to modernize our robot, and you can see everything here in the link (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/Electronics_v2). Besides that, our new firmware is released on our GitLab too (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/Electronics_v2).
About the software, our ongoing research of multi-robot path-planning is fully released on our GitLab (https://gitlab.com/leo_costa/RobotNavigation).
Best regards,
João VictorRoboFEI
ER-Force
Dear Small Size League.
ER-Force would like to submit their current hardware and software framework as well as its autoref for the open source award. [1, 2, 3]
A short summary:
The hardware project reflects the current state of the ER-Force robots, i.e. the new robot generation used by our team during this RoboCup. The hardware is designed in EAGLE (electronics) and Inventor (mechanics). The electronics section contains prebuilt manufacturer files (Gerber) as well as schematics as PDF, the mechanics part is depicted in assembly drawings.
The software framework reflects the open-source simulator as well as some low level algorithms such as our path planning. The software framework is written in C++ and Qt.
Finally, our open-source projects include our well-known autoref, which is used by the league for many years.
Best regards,
MikeER-Force
TIGERs Mannheim
Dear SSL-Community,
as in the past years we are very happy to announce our entry for theOpen Source Award. The usual one-stop shop to get it all was updated:https://github.com/TIGERs-MannheimWe are doing a complete and full release of everything we have,including electronics, mechanics, firmware, our full AI, and someawesome new tools. Here is a brief description of what has changed.
Mechanics:The dribbler dampening and dribbling bar have changed again to improvetraction on the ball. These are mostly material changes. The axes of thesub-wheels changed to be more robust. The release includes the fullrobot mechanics. Inventor CAD files, but also a STEP file of the full robot.
Firmware:Dribbler current control has been improved near zero velocity. Interfaceto the robot’s raspberry pi has been improved with new messages andfeedback of detected balls. The release also includes our wirelessprotocol and base station firmware.
Software (AI):The heart and brain of our team, the central control software “Sumatra”.Of course, compatible with the simulation protocol. So you can test yourAI against ours locally. Pass finding has been largely improved and nowcontains a dynamic learning component. Also watch out for some moreserious dribbling moves which will make you sweat.
RobotPi:The software for ball detection running on a Raspberry Pi 3A+ on each ofour robots. Most of the color blob detection and thresholding has beenrewritten and is parallelized via multi-threading. The RPi uses onlyaround 50% of its CPU now.
TIGERs CLAV (Cut Lengthy Audio/Video):This is an C++ ImGui based application able to cut video files based onan SSL gamelog. You can synchronize multiple videos and gamelogs withindividual markers and the tool can then cut out non-running stages.This tool is still quite new and may not support every video format, butnonetheless it is already a great help to preprocess videos frommatches. Oh and it can create a status overlay video for your videos,too (similar to the status board).
In case you are missing any information or if you are just curios,contact us on Discord or write us an email.

RoboTeam Twente
Dear SSL community,
Hereby, RoboTeam Twente would like to submit our projects for the Open Source Award.
RoboTeam Twente WikiRoboTeam Twente AI SoftwareRoboTeam Twente EmbeddedRoboTeam Twente AutoRefHigh Speed USB Library for STM32Chat-TDP
Our Wiki provides all the mechanical and electrical designs of our robots. Furthermore, it contains the theoretical background and additional explanations about our AI and control software.On our Github you can find our new path planning within our AI code, as well as our innovative dribbler ball-sensor code (see this year’s ETDP).
This year we created an AutoRef, allowing for a majority vote between all AutoRefs. This software is under active development, but our AutoRef will most likely be used during RoboCup 2023.
Next to that, we developed a high speed USB library compatible with our STM32 chip. This results in an enhanced stability when connecting USB devices to the STM32F676ZI. With minor modifications, this is also suitable for other STM chips.Lastly, our latest innovation is our very own Chat-GPT, containing all information on all the (E)TDPs within the SSL. Just ask your question, and the answer will be provided. This Chat-TDP is currently still under construction, but great progress has already been made and we feel like this could be beneficial for all teams within SSL.
Thank you!

RoboJackets
Hello SSL community,
RoboJackets would like to submit our open source work for this SSL award. 
Printed Circuit BoardsRRT Path PlanningGUI, High Level Planning, and Strategy SoftwareFreeRTOS firmware
All information regarding documentation can be found within the repositories. RoboJackets has made all parts of our development open source (RobotCAD is currently unavailable due to GrabCAD being down, and we are searching for alternatives). Some of the main innovations involve practical applications of ROS2 for software and FreeRTOS for on-board robot control. Another goal of ours this year was increased documentation: for example software documentation can be found at this website.
Thank you,
RoboJackets, Georgia Tech

* All deadlines are by the end of the day at any place on Earth

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions until the Team Qualification Material Submission Deadline, which is specified at the beginning of the page:

Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).
Submit a Team Video.
Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2023 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

Team Name
Country
University
Main contact name and email
Website (if you have one)
Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be made via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs must follow these guidelines:

The TDP must contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP must focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations must be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP must have a clear structure and it must be written in clear English.
The TDP must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions. Contrary to the requirements in the linked document the (E)TDP should also include page numbers.
The TDP must be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP must describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
Like last year we have set up a conference management system to handle the peer review process. It is accessible via this link: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2023
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existing account, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To create an account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. To submit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.
TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020 – This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardware improvements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also the reasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for other teams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier for reviewers to read it. It also has no overlaps with the team’s previous paper.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper – This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planning system. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significant changes in that area, and mentioning them would only mean having overlap with the previous paper. The size of the paper is also not excessively long.  
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020 – This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, the mechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It is a bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers each topic well and does not have overlap with the previous paper. 

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time. As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could be significantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. The qualification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old. Due to the COVID pandemic we allow to use a video from 2019, especially from participating in RoboCup Sydney, too. If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams to prove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If your video is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match, teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (see listing below).  The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. For participating in Division A, teams also have to show their ball placement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2023 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in a modern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

CONTENT:
Technical Challenges of the Small Size League are intended to encourage teams to develop solutions to specific problems that will advance the quality of gameplay within the league. Teams are evaluated for their completion of the challenge during a designated time at RoboCup each year.
Rules
Below are the rules for the different RoboCup 2023 technical challenges. Source code associated with these challenges can be found on GitHub.
Chip Pass Challenge
This challenge will be similar to the Pass endurance Hardware Challenge from 2021. The goal is to perform as many passes as possible within a certain time. As an additional challenge, there will be more points if the ball is chipped.
Chip Pass Challenge Rules (HTML)Chip Pass Challenge Rules (PDF)

Ball Placement Challenge
There will be a ball placement challenge similar to previous years, but with an adapted scoring system. Only teams that never participated in division A before may attend it. We will not require attendance, though we strongly encourage teams to do so.

CONTENT:
In 2010, we have two technical challenges. These two challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop interesting technical contributions. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint. Both are designed to be scalable, i.e. every team can participate without much special preparation. Of course, teams who spend extra time on preparing the challenge are more likely to benefit from their work. Please note that both of these two challenges have changed from their respective 2009 versions. All challenges must use the new SSL Shared Vision system and the new standard robot pattern.
Until June 4th (two weeks before the start of the competition), each team that is interested in participating in the challenge has to announce its interest to the OC. This is necessary for the preparation of the schedule.
Mixed Team Challenge – Shooting and Passing
One of the aims of the Small Size League is to foster the development of cooperating agents. The current state of the art is to control all members of one team by a central intelligence instance which has a complete knowledge about the current state of each robot. Even in teams which have a distributed artificial intelligence component, every robot has detailed information about the behaviours of its team members and thus can deduce actions which lead to an overall cooperative behaviour of the whole team. The aim of this challenge is to define a scenario for “real” cooperation, i.e. to let robots cooperate which do not have any knowledge about the internal state of all other robots of their team. This is intended to become realized by mixing existing teams.
A mixed team is defined:
For the 2010 challenge, we consider a mixed team as a team of four robots originating from two different SSL teams. Each of these two sub-teams has to provide two robots. Each sub-team controls their robots with their own software stack. Of course, all members of a mixed team have the same team marker colour. For this year, there will not be any communication between the different sub-teams. A mixed team must use the new SSL Shared Vision system and the new standard robot pattern.
For creating the mixed teams, the following approach will be applied:
After the round robin stage of the soccer competition (i.e. on Tuesday afternoon), the teams for the “Mixed Team Challenge” are separated into two groups. In both groups, every team has to pair with every other team and perform the challenge task. The two best teams from each group will process to the final round according to their score. These teams have to pair with every other team and perform the challenge task again. The total ranking of the challenge can be determined as follows:
The first four teams are ranked by only the number of goals they scored in the final round.The remaining teams are ranked by the number of goals their scored.
The Challenge
Put up two robots from each different teams on the field and score as many goals as possible within 120 seconds. Points are awarded as follows:
1 Point: Scoring a goal after two robots from different teams have touched the ball (i.e. after a pass*)2 Points: Scoring a goal after the ball has been touched at least three times by alternating robots (i.e. after at least two passes*)
*A pass will only be considering as valid if it has involved robots originating from two different teams.
The rules for this challenge:
To start, the mixed team chooses a side of the field. All robots must be placed within 1m from their team’s goal line. Opponent robots will be placed on the field as obstacles. A ball will be placed near one of the corners at the mixed team’s own side of the field. A goal can be scored only when the kicking robot is in the opponent’s half. Once a goal is scored or the ball has left the field, it will be placed again near one of the corners at the own side of the field.

Open Challenge
This challenge is designed to encourage creativity within the Small-Size League, allowing teams to demonstrate interesting research on autonomous mobile robot systems. Each team will demonstrate their research on a standard Small Size League 2010 field, and has to use one or more Small Size League robot(s) as part of the demonstration. In this open challenge, hardware modifications or extensions to the small size robot(s) are acceptable, even if not fully compliant to the standard SSL game rules, as long as the demonstration poses no risk to the people, the field, or the equipment. Teams may use the SSL-Vision system that is provided. Teams are not allowed to mount any additional equipment to the overhead camera bar. Teams can demonstrate their open challenge topics as much as they like within three minute. Each team may also distribute a short presentation or a page of a paper to describe their research. The winner will be decided by a vote from SSL team leaders using a Barda count. Each team will list their top 10 teams in order (excluding themselves). The teams are encouraged to evaluate the performance based on these criteria: Technical strength, novelty, expected impact, and relevance to the league. The time of vote will be within 30 minutes after the last demonstration. Each ranking from each team is converted to points: 10 points for top ranking, 9 points for second, down to 1 point for 10th. Any points awarded by a team to itself will be disregarded. The points awarded by the teams are summed. The team with the highest total score will be the winner of this challenge.
Overall Challenge Ranking
The results from two challenges will be combined to get an overall technical challenge ranking.
To combine the challenge results, we will use the following formula:
Let MIXED_1_SUM be the sum of all points in a group that all teams in a group received in the first round of the mixed team challenge, MIX_2_SUM be the sum of all points that all teams received in the final round of the mixed team challenge, MIXED_1_TEAM be the number of points a single team received in the first round and MIXED_2_TEAM be the number of points a single team received in the final round.
Let OPEN_SUM be the sum of all points that all teams received in open challenge and OPEN_TEAM be the number of points a single team received.
Then
TOTAL_TEAM = ( (MIXED_1_TEAM / MIXED_1_SUM) + (MIX_2_TEAM / MIXED_2_SUM) )/2 + OPEN_TEAM / OPEN_SUM
Time and Fields
The challenge will be conducted during the first and second days in the competition.
Optional Game Demo
If some teams volunteer to show a mixed full 5 vs. 5 SSL soccer match, we would strongly appreciate and support this. Nevertheless, this will not be considered for the overall challenge ranking.

CONTENT:
Two technical challenges will be held at RoboCup 2015. These challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop technical contributions and to test ideas that can evolve the league towards the RoboCup goal of 2050. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint, and the Committees encourage all the participating teams to compete in the challenges.
11-vs-11 Mixed Team Challenge
The 11 on 11 Technical challenge is a full match between two teams of up to 11 robots, each composed of robots from two different SSL teams (here referred to as sub-teams). Each robot must be controlled by its originating sub-team’s software. Sub-team pairings will be randomly drawn. The winners will be determined based on the number of valid goals scored.
Communication
Communication between the two sub-teams of a team is allowed, according to the following specifications:
Messages are sent as UDP packets encoded with Google protobuf to port 10012.Sub-teams communicate only a rough plan for each of their robots using the TeamPlan message specified by the multi_team_communication.proto Google protobuf:
 package multi_team_comm;
 //Protocol to communicate rough plans to other teammates
 //Units are specified as follows:
 //length - millimeters
 //time - seconds
 //angle - radians
 
 //Plan of a list of robots
 message TeamPlan {
   repeated RobotPlan plans = 1;
 }
 
 //Plan of a single robot
 message RobotPlan {
   //ID of the robot from SSL vision
   required uint32 robot_id = 1;
   //Role that this robot is assuming
   // 0 - no specified role
   // 1 - goalie
   // 2 - defense
   // 3 - offense
   optional int32 role = 2;
   //Planned navigation target
   optional Pose nav_target = 3;
   //Planned shot target
   optional Location shot_target = 4;
 }
 
 // Location message, in mm. The center of the field is specified as (0, 0).
 // Positive x axis points to the opponent's goal
 message Location {
   required int32 x = 1;
   required int32 y = 2;
 }
 
 message Pose {
   //location of the robot
   optional Location loc = 1;
   //heading of the robot
   optional float heading = 2;
 };

Rules
Standard SSL rules apply to mixed team games with the following additions:
A mixed team is formed from robots of two sub-teams.The maximum robot number is increased to 11 per mixed team. Each sub-team may have only a maximum of 5 players on the field at any time. Each sub-team may additionally provide a goalkeeper for one period. The goal keeper for the second period must not be provided by the same sub-team that provided the goalkeeper for the first period.Goals are only valid if robots from both of the two sub-teams forming a mixed team have touched the ball since the last stoppage of play.
Shared Radio Protocol Challenge
Overview
The goal of the shared radio protocol is to demonstrate teams playing soccer using other teams’ robots. This will allow (for example) teams of heterogeneous hardware, or mixed teams with one team’s software and another’s hardware.
For this technical challenge, the team that provides the robot hardware will be called the Radio Server Team (RST), and the team that controls the robots via software will be called the Radio Client Team (RCT). The RST will run a server that accepts data on the UDP port number 10010, receives the radio commands in the specified protobuf format, and send the commands over their own radio to the robots. The RCT will run the control software that will send radio commands in the specified protobuf format to the UDP port 10010 of the RST. This setup is depicted in the following figure:
Radio Protocol
The radio commands are sent as UDP packets encoded with Google protobuf, with the following protobuf definitions. Each wrapper packet contains multiple radio commands, for each of the robots to be controlled.
message RadioProtocolWrapper {
  repeated RadioProtocolCommand command = 1;
}

message RadioProtocolCommand {
  // The unique ID of the robot, as identified by SSL-Vision.
  required int32 robot_id = 1;

  // Desired forward drive velocity in meters / second.
  required float velocity_x = 2;

  // Desired sideways left drive velocity in meters / second.
  required float velocity_y = 3;

  // Desired counterclockwise angular velocity in radians / second.
  required float velocity_r = 4;

  // Desired flat kick speed, in meters / second.
  // If this optional field is missing, then no flat kick command should be
  // sent.
  optional float flat_kick = 5;

  // Desired chip kick distance, in meters.
  // If this optional field is missing, then no flat kick command should be
  // sent. If this field is present along with the flat_kick field, the
  // flat_kick command takes precedence.
  optional float chip_kick = 6;

  // Desired dribbler spin, from -1 to +1, where -1 is the maximum reverse-spin
  // that can be imparted to the ball, and +1 is the maximum forward-spin
  // that can be imparted to the ball.
  optional float dribbler_spin = 7;
}

Source Code
Source code for the defined protobufs, and sample RST and RCT executables, is available on GitHub.
Scoring
Both teams, the RST and the RCT are awarded the specified number of points each for every skill from the following list that they perform:
Driving a single robot in a straight line along the length of the field twice, from touching one goal line to the other goal line at the other end of the field, and back, along the middle of the field (1 point)Intercepting a moving ball travelling at ≥ 1 m/s, and bringing it to a stop. (1 point)Scoring a goal against a stopped defence consisting of centrally placed goalie and 2 defenders (1 point)Scoring a goal against a stopped defence consisting of centrally placed goalie and 2 defenders by a one-touch (deflection) kick of a moving ball travelling at ≥ 1 m/s. (2 points)Scoring a goal on the stopped defence after a pass between two robots (2 points).Scoring a goal on a moving 3-robot defence after a pass between two robots (2 points).
The skills will be evaluated as follows:
For skills involving moving balls, the ball will be rolled in by a human from the goal line towards the center of the field.For the skills involving scoring goals, the trials are started from game off state with the ball at the center of the field.For direct goal scoring, a force start referee command will be sent. For indirect goal scoring with passes, an indirect free kick referee command will be sent.Points are scored only once per skill. No additional points are awarded for repeating a skill, either to the RST, or RCT, with the same, or any other RST-RCT pairing.The RST team will be monitoring the computer, commands sent, and the robots, and may, at their discretion, abort the communication and end the trial at any time.The RCT and RST must both take appropriate precautions to maintain safety of the robots, and are expected to partake in the challenge in fair spirit. The RCT will not be held liable for any possible damage to the RST’s robots.

CONTENT:
In 2009, we have two basic technical challenges, similar to 2008. These two basic challenges are intended to compare technical abilities needed for successfully playing robot soccer. Both are designed to be scalable, i.e. every team can participate almost without much special preparation. Of course, teams who spend extra time on preparing the challenge will probably benefit from their work. Please note that both of these two challenges have changed slightly from their respective 2008 versions.
Additionally to the two basic challenges, we have an enhanced Challenge for Mixed Team Play which will also involve the usage of the new SSL Shared Vision System.
Basic Challenge 1 – Shooting and Passing
Put up two to three robots on the field and score as many goals as possible within 120 seconds. Points are awarded as follows:
1 Point: Scoring a goal after two robots have touched the ball (i.e. after a pass)2 Points: Scoring a goal after the ball has been touched at least three times by alternating robots (i.e. after at least two passes)
The rules for this challenge:
To start, all robots must be placed within 1m from the own goal line.Opponent robots will be placed on the field as obstacles.A ball will be placed near one of the corners at the own side of the field.A goal can be scored only when the kicking robot is in the opponent’s half.Once a goal is scored or the ball has left the field, it will be placed again near one of the corners at the own side of the field.
Basic Challenge 2 – Navigation
Two sets of obstacles (all within 180mm diameter and marked with a standard blue or yellow center marker) are placed at each side of the field, at the approximate initial coordinates as shown in the attached sketch. One robot starts at the center of the field and must drive from one penalty mark of the field to the other as many times as possible within 120s. It must do so by alternating the side of entry between the two sets of obstacles, thus effectively driving a figure-eight. Every successful lap (from one set of obstacles to the other and back, while maintaining the figure-eight requirement) counts as one point. If it touches an obstacle, it gets a penalty of -1 points. Note, that the positions of the obstacles can change slightly during the execution of this challenge (e.g. by a robot bumping into them, or by a human repositioning them), so your system should accomodate for that.
Additionally, teams are allowed to use up to three robots in parallel and sum up their laps. If two robots touch each other, the penalty also applies (per touching event, not per robot, of course).
If a robot has driven at least one lap (independently of the number of collisions), the team’s minimum number of points will be 1.
The red line indicates an example trajectory of a robot performing this challenge.
Mixed Team Challenge
One of the aims of the Small Size League is to foster the development of cooperating agents. The current state of the art is to control all members of one team by a central intelligence instance which has a complete knowledge about the current state of each robot. Even in teams which have a distributed artificial intelligence component, every robot has detailed information about the behaviours of its team members and thus can deduce own actions which lead to an overall cooperative behaviour of the whole team. The aim of this challenge is to define a scenario for “real” cooperation, i.e. to let robots cooperate which do not have any knowledge about the internal state of all other robots of their team. This is intended to become realized by mixing existing teams which then have to accomplish a modified version of the “Shooting and Passing Challenge”.
Mixing Teams
First of all, a mixed team needs to be defined:
For the 2009 challenge, we consider a mixed team as a team of four robots originating from two different SSL teams. Each of these two sub-teams has to provide two robots. Every robot is controlled by its own software stack. Of course, all members of a mixed team have the same team marker colour. For this year, there will not be any communication between the different sub-teams. A mixed team must use the new SSL Shared Vision system.
As procedure for creating the mixed teams, the following approach will be applied:
Until June 17th (two weeks before the start of the competition), each team that is interested in participating in the challenge has to announce its interest to the OC. This is necessary for the preparation of the schedule.Every team that intends to participate in the mixed team challenge has to successfully participate in the “Shooting and Passing Challenge”, i.e. to score at least three points. This is necessary to assure a minimum level of passing skills.After the round robin stage of the soccer competition (i.e. on Friday afternoon), the teams for the “Mixed Team Challenge” become generated semi-randomly. Since there are several field assignment constraints for the finals (see section about “Time and Fields”) not every pair of teams is reasonable from an organizational point of view.
The Challenge
The task to accomplish is almost identical to the “Shooting and Passing Challenge”. Except the different number of robots (exactly four instead of up to three), the only difference is the scoring scheme: A pass will only be considering as valid if it has involved robots originating from two different teams.
Time and Fields
The challenge will be conducted during the two final days. Among the finals and the Humanoid Small Size demonstrations, there will be – especially on Sunday – enough free time slots. These slots will become assigned dynamically on site. There will be four SSL fields at the competition site. One of these fields will be used for Humanoid Small Size demonstrations during the weekend. Two others (on Sunday only one) are needed for official games. The remaining field can be used exclusively for the challenge. The two game fields can also be used (e.g. by those teams still participating in the competition) but only in a way that minimally disturbs the preparations for the official games.
Optional Game Demo
If some teams volunteer to show a mixed full 5 vs. 5 SSL soccer match, we would strongly appreciate and support this. Nevertheless, this will not be considered for the overall challenge ranking.
Overall Challenge Ranking
The results from the three challenges will be combined to get an overall technical challenge ranking.
To combine the challenge results, we will use the following formula:
Let BALL_SUM be the sum of all points that all teams received in the ball challenge and BALL_TEAM the number of points a single team received. Assume the same for the other two challenge (NAV_* and MIXED_* respectively).
Then TOTAL_TEAM = BALL_TEAM / BALL_SUM + NAV_TEAM / NAV_SUM + MIXED_TEAM / MIXED_SUM

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions by January 29th, 2019:
Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).Submit a Team Video.Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2019 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:Team NameCountryUniversityMain contact name and emailWebsite (if you have one)Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)Short rationale for the preferred division
Please pay attention to the following points:
Communication will be made via e-mail, using the Small Size mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The TDP should contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.The TDP should focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations should be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.The TDP should have a clear structure and it should be written in clear English.The TDP should be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions.
In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The ETDP should describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.The ETDP should be at least 6 pages long.To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.
Submission Information
We have set up a conference management system to handle this years peer review process. It can be accessed at http://conferences.cs.umass.edu/robocup-ssl-2019
Every team can register and upload their qualification materials to the site.
- Registration: Main page, select " I'm a new user and want to create an account"
- Submission: After logging in, click on "Start new paper" (https://conferences.cs.umass.edu/robocup-ssl-2019/paper/new)
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage. The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):
A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. The game should be based on contemporary rules (2011 and afterwards).A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.
The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:
Subject: 2019 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.The URL of your video, which must be available via FTP or HTTP.
Please pay attention to the following:
Please submit a single video file.The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

CONTENT:
Two technical challenges and a demo will be held in Istanbul 2011.
These challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop technical contributions and to test ideas that can evolve the league towards the RoboCup goal of 2050. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint. Both are designed to be scalable, i.e. every team can participate, and the Committes urge all the competing teams to compete in the challenges. Please note that both of these two challenges have changed from their previous versions.
Until June 20th (two weeks before the start of the competition), teams interested in participating in the challenge need to announce its interest to the OC. This is necessary for the preparation of the schedule.
Dynamic Navigation Challenge
**This challenge was used at the Iran open, with slight differences
The aim of this technical challenge is examine the ability of robots to safely navigate in a dynamic environment.
As it is shown in the pictures, there are 6 robots acting as obstacles, two stationary and four moving along a straight line. The approximate positions and trajectories are depicted in the figures. The actual position may vary.
1.1) The maximum number of participating robots are limited to 3.
1.2) The participating robots must navigate between the two stationary obstacles as shown in pictures.
1.3) Whenever a robot touches an obstacle or its teammate it will receive a penalty (-1).
1.4) Each successful navigation cycle for each robot is scored (+1).
1.5) Robots who can perform the cycle carrying the ball score (+3).
1.6) The challenge time is 2 minutes.
Mixed Team Match Challenge
This is a full match between mixed teams, each composed of five robots originating from two different SSL teams. One of the SSL teams must provide three robots and the other must provide two. Each robot will be controlled by its originating SSL team own software stack.
2.3) Teams who want to participate in this challenge must confirm its intention to the OC until June 20th. The OC also urges teams who want to participate to try to adjust their software before the match.
2.1) All SSL rules will apply
2.2) The mixed team can swap which of the originating teams provides three and which provides two robots
2.3) After the round robin stage of the soccer competition the teams for the “Mixed Team Challenge” become generated semi-randomly
Large Field Demo
A mixed match, similar to the Mixed Team Match Challenge, between 6 to 8 robots on each side, where each SSL Team will provide half of the robots for the mixed team. The field of play will consist of two official SSL-Fields joined as one, with SSL-Vision operating with four cameras. The log files of the demo games will be available after the competition to all SSL teams, and will serve to foster the development of systems capable of using the large field.
D.1) Teams who want to participate in this challenge must confirm its intention to the OC until June 20th.
D.2) All rules of the Mixed Team Challenge apply.
D.3) Participation on this demo is conditioned to participation on the Mixed Team Challenge

CONTENT:
In 2008, we will have a challenge setup similar to 2007. There will be two challenges to compare technical abilities needed for successfully playing robot soccer. Both are designed to be scalable, i.e. every team can participate almost without much special preparation. Of course, teams who spend extra time on preparing the challenge will probably benefit from their work.
Challenge 1 – Shooting and Passing
Put up to three robots on the field and score as many goals as possible within 120 seconds. Points are awarded as follows:
1 Point: Scoring a goal after only one robot has touched the ball2 Points: Scoring a goal after two robots have touched the ball (i.e. after a pass)3 Points: Scoring a goal after the ball has been touched at least three times by alternating robots (i.e. after at least two passes)
The rules for this challenge:
To start, all robots must be placed within 1m from the own goal line.Opponent robots will be placed on the field as obstacles.A ball will be placed near one of the corners at the own side of the field.A goal can be scored only when the kicking robot is in the opponent’s half.Once a goal is scored or the ball has left the field, it will be placed again near one of the corners at the own side of the field.
Challenge 2 – Navigation
Two sets of obstacles (see attached sketch) are placed at each side of the field. One robot starts at the center of the field and must drive from one penalty mark of the field to the other as many times as possible within 120s. Every lap (from one set of obstacles to the other and back) counts as one point. Each time it has to drive through the gap between two obstacles. If it touches an obstacle, it gets a penalty of -1 points.
Additionally, teams are allowed to use up to three robots in parallel and sum up their laps. If two robots touch each other, the penalty also applies (per touching event, not per robot, of course).
If a robot has driven at least one lap (independently of the number of collisions), the team’s minimum number of points will be 1.
The red line indicates an example trajectory of a robot performing this challenge.
Challenges – Overall Ranking
The results from both challenges will be combined to get an overall technical challenge ranking.
To combine the challenge results, we will use the following formula:
Let BALL_SUM be the sum of all points that all teams received in the ball challenge and BALL_TEAM the number of points a single team received. Assume the same for the navigation challenge (NAV_*).
Then TOTAL_TEAM = BALL_TEAM / BALL_SUM + NAV_TEAM / NAV_SUM

CONTENT:
Two technical challenges will be held at RoboCup 2013.
These challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop technical contributions and to test ideas that can evolve the league towards the RoboCup goal of 2050. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint, and the Committes encourages all the participating teams to compete in the challenges.
Until May 31st, teams interested in participating in any of the challenges need to announce their interest to the Organizing Committee . This is necessary for the preparation of the schedules. Please state in which challenges your team is planning to participate.
Shooting Challenge
This challenge will test the team’s shooting accuracy and ability to score a goal against four slowly moving defenders and one goal keeper. The task is to score from seven fixed positions in the field of play as depicted in the image below. The aim of this challenge is to score as many goals as possible.
Each team is allowed to have a single robot on the field of play during the challenge.The exact ball positions might be subject of change.The balls are placed one by one by the referee.For each ball position a “direct freekick” command is issued by the referee box. After the shot has been completed a “stop” signal will be sent and the next ball is placed.During ball placement a “halt” signal might be sent due to vision interference. Robots need to adhere to the “halt” signal and stop moving.The standard rules for the execution of a direct freekick apply, e.g., no double touch and lack of progress. During stop mode the robot needs to keep distance.Four defenders will move slowly along the outside of the defense area. The goal keeper will move slowly between the goal posts.Own goals by the slowly moving defenders or goalie are not counted.It is not allowed to interfere with the defenders or goal keeper. If the attacker contacts any of the defenders or the goal keeper, the number of goals is reduced by one.
Each team will have a single turn. Each ball position will be used twice. Therefore, a maximum of 14 goals can be achieved.
Each team is allowed to cancel the turn and restart the challenge once. The turn may be cancelled only before the last shot has been taken.
Navigation Challenge
Three robots have to navigate through a dozen of static obstacles from the left side of the field to the right side of the field, while crossing the center point of the field. The obstacles are randomly distributed in the center of the field. The goal is to reach the target positions as fast as possible.
Obstacles are randomly scattered in a virtual circle around the center of the field of play. It will be ensured that at least one path with the width of at least two robot diameters will exist through the obstacles to the center of the field from each side of the field. Examples of possible routes are depicted in the image below as lines with arrows. It does not matter which particular robot fills each target position.Teams will not be allowed to test with the final obstacle configuration before the technical challenge.Each team needs to have three robots navigating through the field, placed in each corner (corner kick position) and the penalty point as shown in the image below. Blue points are starting positions and yellow points are targets.All robots have to reach the center of field (indicated in violet in the image below) before reaching their target, such that a successful pass is recorded. If a robot moves to the target position without reaching the center of the field, a successful pass is not counted until the robot moves to the center of the field first and then moves back to its target position.Each collision with an obstacle will result in a time penalty of 5 seconds.Each collision with another robot will result in a time penalty of 7 seconds.Pushing or substantially dislocating an obstacle will result in a time penalty of 10 seconds.To begin the challenge a “force start” signal will be sent from the referee box and the clock is started.The clock will be stopped once the last robot as reached its final target and stopped moving. It is understood that the target position and center point might not be reached exactly due to vision noise. An error of 5cm is considered to be sufficient for this challenge.
Each team has two tries, and the best time is recorded as the final result.

AutoRef Challenge

Goal of the Technical Challenge
This document is intended to describe the requirements of AutoRef software. The goal of this software is to help the human referee by automating decisions.

The Technical Challenge is conducted entirely before RoboCup 2016. 
Extended deadline for the AutoRef version that will be evaluated: March 14th 2016 (old deadline: Feb 28th 2016)

Setup and Requirements
The Autoref receives vision packets and sends its decisions to the traditional SSL Refbox which forwards
these referee commands to the actual game.
Both programs run on the same computer and communicate via network sockets.

The Refbox listens on Port 10007 for TCP connections communicating in the Refbox remote control format. 
The goal is to provide software that:

 detects as many infringements as possible (Alertness) minimize the number of false decisions (Accuracy) detects as many different infringements as possible (Completeness) subordinates to any decision a human makes on the Refbox is able to send commands for AutoPlacement has the ability to log a game in order to evaluate decisions is able to run on Ubuntu 14.04, with clear build instructions.
Evaluation
Subsequently,
 the submitted software will be tested. Every team is encouraged to 
conduct the tests and share their results. Ideally, a video of the tests
 is provided.

 A correctly detected rule infringement adds 1 point to the score of this Technical Challenge.  Every infringement will be tested multiple times according to the maximum number of points that is stated below. Wrong detection will subtract 2 points. Negative points in single infringements are possible.  The total points are the sum of all points. If the sum is negative,
 the result is treated as 0 points in this Technical Challenge.  The points will be normalized by the maximum number of points, which is 50. A team with 38 points will receive a 76% rating for this Technical challenge.

Submission
So far, the following AutoRef software has been submitted: CMDragons ER-Force Tigers Mannheim 

Autonomous Ball Placement

Goal of the Technical Challenge
The
 intention of this feature is to minimize the time needed to restart the
 game. This is achieved by placing the ball autonomously by robots (“AutoPlacement“).

The Technical Challenge is conducted on Thursday, after the games. 

Procedure
AutoPlacement commands are issued by the AutoRef software. They are forwarded by the Refbox as game states BallPlacementYellow or BallPlacementBlue and include the requested ball position. Before and after those commands the game is in Stop state.
AutoPlacement may be requested before any referee decision, e.g. before kickoffs, direct or indirect freekicks, or penalties.

During ball placement the same rules apply as in Stop state. The only exception is that robots of one team are allowed to approach the ball, according to the team that is mentioned in the BallPlacement state.

The ball is considered placed successfully if the following conditions apply:

 no more than 15 seconds passed since the placement command there is no robot within 50cm distance to the ball the ball is stationary the ball is at a position within 10cm radius from the requested position
This means that the robot has to move away from the ball once the team considers the ball placed correctly.

In the case of failure, the AutoRef will command the other team 
to place the ball. The team that receives the ball after the placement 
remains the same. 
If both teams fail to place the ball, Stop will be sent and the ball is 
placed by the human referee.

If a team has not implemented ball placement or fails AutoPlacement the third time in a half game,
 AutoPlacement is disabled for this team in the AutoRef software. In 
this case, the other team will receive the AutoPlacement request. If 
AutoPlacement is disable for both teams, the human ref places the ball 
at all times.

If the ball left the field surroundings (e.g. after a chip kick) or is not visible, the ball is always placed by the human ref.

Evaluation
The TC reserves the right to change the evaluation procedure.

Every team places the ball in the same situations. The number and
 kind of situations will be determined by the TC. The command will be 
issued and the teams have to place the ball in 15 seconds and move away 
from the ball. 

A point will be awarded for every successfully placed ball. The  points will be normalized and merged with the 11 vs. 11 Technical  challenge. 

11v11 Mixed Team Challenge

The 11 on 11 Technical challenge is a full match between two teams of
 up to 11 robots, each composed of robots from two different SSL teams 
(here referred to as sub-teams). Each robot must be controlled by its 
originating sub-team’s software. Sub-team pairings will rotate so that 
each team plays with all possible partner teams.

Communication
Communication between the two sub-teams of a team is allowed, according to the following specifications:

 Messages are sent as UDP packets encoded with Google protobuf to port 10012. Sub-teams communicate only a rough plan for each of their robots using the TeamPlan message specified by the multi_team_communication.proto Google protobuf:
 package multi_team_comm;
 //Protocol to communicate rough plans to other teammates
 //Units are specified as follows:
 //length - millimeters
 //time - seconds
 //angle - radians
 
 //Plan of a list of robots
 message TeamPlan {
   repeated RobotPlan plans = 1;
 }
 
 //Plan of a single robot
 message RobotPlan {
   //ID of the robot from SSL vision
   required uint32 robot_id = 1;
   //Role that this robot is assuming
   // 0 - no specified role
   // 1 - goalie
   // 2 - defense
   // 3 - offense
   optional int32 role = 2;
   //Planned navigation target
   optional Pose nav_target = 3;
   //Planned shot target
   optional Location shot_target = 4;
 }
 
 // Location message, in mm. The center of the field is specified as (0, 0).
 // Positive x axis points to the opponent's goal
 message Location {
   required int32 x = 1;
   required int32 y = 2;
 }
 
 message Pose {
   //location of the robot
   optional Location loc = 1;
   //heading of the robot
   optional float heading = 2;
 };

Rules
Standard SSL rules apply to mixed team games with the following additions:

 A mixed team is formed from robots of two sub-teams. The maximum robot number is increased to 11 per mixed team. Each 
sub-team may have only a maximum of 5 players on the field at any time. 
Each sub-team may additionally provide a goalkeeper for one period. The 
goal keeper for the second period must not be provided by the same 
sub-team that provided the goalkeeper for the first period. Goals are only valid if robots from both of the two sub-teams 
forming a mixed team have touched the ball since the last stoppage of 
play. The robots must be able to submit to a speed limit imposed by the 
referee, subject to change during the game due to safety concerns. Teams
 will be allowed to touch their computers for up to a minute if the 
speed limit is changed; this time will be used exclusively to change the
 speed configuration as requested.
Field Setup
The size of the field will be approximately 13.4 meters by 9 meters, as shown below.

For the quad-size field setup, a total of eight cameras will be used, with two
separate computers running ssl-vision. 
The coordinate system, and camera layout will be as shown in the following
figure:

Computer 0 will run process images from cameras 0-3, and computer 1 will process images from cameras 4-7. On ssl-vision on computer 0, cameras 4-7 will be enumerated, but not running. On ssl-vision on computer 1, cameras 0-3 will be enumerated, but not running. Both computers will publish their data to the standard ssl-vision UDP multicast and port, 224.5.23.2:10006 
The quad-size-field branch of SSL-Vision has been pre-configured to the coordinate system and camera assignment for the quad-size field.

Field Configuration

The RoboCup 2018 will feature 3 fields.
Field A: 9x12m, used for official games of division AField B: 6x9m, used for official games of division BField C: 6x9m, used for testing (both divisions)
The time before the scheduled start of official games is reserved for the two opposing teams of the next match. If there is no time left between the end of a match and the scheduled start of the next match, testing time on the playing field cannot be granted.
On field C, testing time slots will be distributed by the OC. There will be three options:
One team can use the field as a half of a division A field (there will be a large goal as well)One team can use it as a full-size division B fieldTwo teams can use it simultaneously as a half of a division B field
After all games of the day have finished, all teams are free to test on either field. If there is too much demand, the OC will also coordinate it.

Tournament Format

Division A
Teams in division A will play a round robin group stage followed by a double elimination playoff stage.There are two groups, with 5 and 4 teamsThe team that places first or second the group starts in the upper bracketThe other teams start in the lower bracketNo team drops out after the group stage
Group Stage
Every group consists of three teams from pool 1 and one or two teams from pool 2The pools were decided using the results of previous official tournamentsThe rule that there is no more than 1 team from the same country in the same group will not be usedThe groups will be assigned using the SSL grouping tool and random.org
PoolTeam1CMμs1ER-Force1ZJUNlict1RoboDragons1TIGERs Mannheim1Immortals2KIKS2UMass MinuteBots2RoboTeam Twente
Playoff Stage

Division B
Teams in division B will play a six-round swiss formatIn the first round, the match-ups are drawn using www.random.orgIn the other 5 rounds, the match-ups are decided using the following criteriaEvery team will be ranked using points (3 times the number of wins plus the number of draws), the goal difference and the goals shot (identical to the round robin group stage ranking)The best team will skip the next round, but only if it has not skipped a round beforeNo team plays against the same opponent twiceEvery team will play against an opponent that ranks as close as possibleAt the end of the tournament, the team with the highest rank wins
Schedule
The match-ups of the next round will be announced only one hour before the first game!The teams that played in the last game of a round will not have to play in the first game of the following round

CONTENT:
Three technical challenges will be held at RoboCup 2014, out of which the Double-Size Field technical challenge is compulsory for teams to proceed beyond the round-robins.
These challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop technical contributions and to test ideas that can evolve the league towards the RoboCup goal of 2050. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint, and the Committees encourages all the participating teams to compete in the challenges.
Double-Size Field Challenge
For a team to qualify beyond the round robins, they must successfully participate in the double-sized field technical challenge. Successful participation is declared after scoring at least 2 points. Points will be awarded for the demonstrating the following skills on the double-sized field, where each skill is scored only once:
Taking a kickoff without a force-start (1 point).Scoring a goal against a stopped defense consisting of centrally placed goalie and 2 defenders (1 point).Taking an indirect free kick from the goal line without a force start (1 point).Scoring a goal on the stopped defense after a pass between two robots (2 points).Scoring a goal on a moving 3-robot defense after a pass between two robots (4 points).
In addition to these points, additional bonus points will be awarded to teams that play on the double-sized field for actual competition matches:
You get 4 bonus points if you played at least 1 game on the double sized field.For every goal scored in your best (highest scoring) double sized field game you get 3 bonus points. This includes goals from penalty kicks.
Procedure for the Double-Sized Technical Challenge:
The challenge starts with a kickoff.If the team successfully scores a point from the kickoff, the challenge continues according to the normal rules of the game, except all free kicks are awarded to the playing team.If the team is unsuccessful at scoring a point from the kickoff, they may request another kickoff in lieu of a free kick the next time the ball goes out of play.The challenge concludes at either the 5-minute time, or when the team withdraws after scoring at least 2 points.
Automatic Referee Challenge
This challenge will test the accuracy of a team’s autonomous referee software. Software entered in this challenge does not need to be capable of autonomously running an entire game; rather, the intent of this technical challenge is to demonstrate building blocks and provide a solid foundation on which others can build more advanced autonomous referee systems.
A team will be awarded the specified number of points after the software correctly identifies the specified event for the third time (no further points are awarded for additional detections, nor for two or fewer detections of a particular event):
The ball has exited the field, and which team most recently touched it: 1 pointThe RoboCup 2014 rule regarding multiple defenders in the defence area is violated, by which team, and to which extent (partial or full occupation): 1 pointRobots have collided violently, and which team was at fault: 2 pointsThe ball was kicked above 8 m/s, and by which team: 1 pointThe ball was kicked above 15 cm above the field surface and crossed the midfield line before bouncing or touching another robot (a new penalty at RoboCup 2014 defined in section 12.3), and which team last touched the ball before the violation: 2 pointsOne robot is pushing another without the robots first colliding violently, and which robot is pushing: 6 points
Any software that identifies one of the above events when it did not, in fact, occur will lose one point per false positive identification.
To participate in this challenge, all autonomous referees must be designed to receive SSL-Vision and referee box packets from the network to identify game state, and must be configured to avoid sending any packets onto the network.
To avoid any unfair benefit, all participants will simultaneously judge a single live RoboCup game. All autonomous referees will be attached to the field network. A neutral third party will monitor each autonomous referee computer’s display; teams are responsible for making their autonomous referee software easy enough to explain to this third party. Please consider the use of a scrolling log format (this could be as simple as writing messages to standard output), for ease of reading and re-examination of past output. The neutral third party will record each instance of an event identified by the autonomous referee, along with whether the positive identification was true or false.
For the purposes of this technical challenge, a positive identification is considered true if and only if the human referee on duty at the game makes the same call. As the purpose of this challenge is to detect specific events, not to run a complete game, the referee will be requested to announce all relevant events, including those (s)he would not normally call due to e.g. the precedence rules or anticipated benefit rules set out in section 5.2 if the Laws of the Game. The referee will also be requested to consider input from his/her assistant when announcing these events, as some events may happen outside the referee’s line of sight.
In order to be declared as successfully participating in this technical challenge, a team’s autonomous referee software must:
execute for the duration of the game without human input, except that teams are permitted to work on their referee software during half-time and similar scheduled breaks in gameplay (but not during timeouts)have a score of at least two points when the game endshave its source code publicly available, under a license that could not reasonably prevent either other teams or the league from using the software or incorporating the code into their own autonomous referee systems (copyleft open-source licenses such as GPL are acceptable), along with any necessary documentation on compiling and running the software
Common Command Protocol Challenge

Dear SSL-community,
as most of you should already know by now, we use to publish all our work each year during or after each RoboCup since we first participated in 2011.
And we continue with this attitude, because we belief in the importance of sharing knowledge to advance our league and the RoboCup.
Below, you will find a list of our publications and a list of the most significant changes. The documentation or description is included within the individual packages.
Mechanics
– Modified the curved front shape of the straight kicking plunger. This significantly reduced the spread of kicked balls when they are not perfectly at the center in front of the robot.
– Enlarged the infrared barrier PCBs on the sides of the dribbling device to prevent the silicon rubbers of the linear damping mechanism to fall out seldomly.
Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Mechanics-2018.zip
Electronics
– Usage of a new wireless module: Semtech SX1280
– Schematics and PCB layout of a tiny 34x18mm module with a single SX1280 module. Pin-compatible with most nRF24L01+ breakout boards on the market (SX1280.pdf).
– Schematics and PCB layout of a completely new base station using one SX1280 module and the SKY66112 front-end module for enhanced output power and antenna switching. Features network connectivity and a 5″ touchscreen with 800×480 pixels.
Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Electronics-2018.zip
Firmware
– Support for the SX1280 and SKY66112 modules (in base station and mainboard code).
– Enhanced wireless transfer protocol to make best use of the new modules.
– Adaption of the base station code to the new hardware (incl. completely new user interface).
– Base station touchscreen supports manual control of a single robot for demonstration purposes.
– Base station can be configured via touchscreen.
– New feature: Asynchronous Bang-Bang trajectories. They are intentionally not synchronized on the X and Y trajectory to reach a specific line/direction faster.
– Major update of robot controller and sensor fusion. The robot now uses a state space controller with acceleration output and model-based friction compensation when a position source (e.g. SSL Vision) is available. If not position source is available, local velocity output is used with a velocity-error correction for encoder readings. All models are derived from empirical data.
Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Firmware-2018.zip
Software (TIGERs AutoRef)
– Detect more rule violations
– Updated to new rules
– Significantly improved ball speed detection and chip kick detection (see Vision Filter)
Code: https://gitlab.tigers-mannheim.de/open-source/AutoReferee
Software (AI)
– Enhanced the integrated AutoRef for full automatic simulation of two teams playing against each other
– Offensive Action Trees for self learning offensive behaviors (see ETDP)
– Multiple new supportive behaviors for supporting the attacker
– Improved the selection of the best suited attacker that should handle the ball
– Improved the skills that handle the ball, like kicking, receiving, redirecting, approaching and catching
– Integrated new asynchronous bang bang trajectories into multiple skills
– More robust path planning with ahead-of-time emergency brakeRelease: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Software-2018.tar.gz
Software (Vision Filter)
– New chip kick model: We are now using fixed restitution coefficients for all hops in Z direction, for the first hop in XY direction, and for all further hops in XY direction (3 parameters in total).
– Online straight kick and chip kick estimation has been updated to use a direct simplex-based optimization method.
– Chip kick estimation can now optimize a complete trajectory, not only two hops.
– An additional optimizer can estimate all model parameters for a straight and chip kick with an evolutionary algorithm (CMAES). Model parameters can now be fully calculated within Sumatra, no further external software required.
– The Vision Filter is completey integrated into our official AutoRef software.
– Kick information from  our own robots is now used as a-priori knowledge for estimation.
– The viewport architect, which aligns the viewports of the different cameras and tries to minimize overlap, now supports different modes of how the viewports are calculated. Based on field size, camera positions, camera projections, or dynamically on detected robot positions.
– Correction of inbound SSL Vision timestamps. The average rate of each camera is estimated and the timestamps are corrected for each camera, mitigating network and processing delays. This increases filter accuracy for ball and robots.
Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Software-2018.tar.gz
Software (status-board)
– A new application for visualizing referee information during a game including new game events that are announced by the autoRefs.
– Additionally, a live view of the field.
Code: https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-status-board-client
Application is available here (and will so during the RoboCup): https://tigers-mannheim.de/status-board/
Looking forward to seeing you all in Montreal 🙂

Immortals
Dear SSL Community,
We would like to share our 3D-printed SSL robot designs with you. We think that our design can evolve with help from other community members to become the standard robot design for the SSL teams in the future.Since most teams are getting into the struggle of manufacturing a high number of robots to meet the new rules of the league, we thought it would be good to share this design with other teams so they can save time on the mechanical part of their projects.
In this work, we have made a great focus on 3D-printing technologies. Nowadays, 3D-printers, unlike CNC machines, are widely accessible to individuals and organizations. 
All mechanical documents of our design have been published and will be updated frequently.
The latest releases can be found here:

SOURCE: https://ssl.robocup.org/robocups/robocup-2008-technical-challenges/
CONTENT:
In 2008, we will have a challenge setup similar to 2007. There will be two challenges to compare technical abilities needed for successfully playing robot soccer. Both are designed to be scalable, i.e. every team can participate almost without much special preparation. Of course, teams who spend extra time on preparing the challenge will probably benefit from their work.
Challenge 1 – Shooting and Passing
Put up to three robots on the field and score as many goals as possible within 120 seconds. Points are awarded as follows:
1 Point: Scoring a goal after only one robot has touched the ball2 Points: Scoring a goal after two robots have touched the ball (i.e. after a pass)3 Points: Scoring a goal after the ball has been touched at least three times by alternating robots (i.e. after at least two passes)
The rules for this challenge:
To start, all robots must be placed within 1m from the own goal line.Opponent robots will be placed on the field as obstacles.A ball will be placed near one of the corners at the own side of the field.A goal can be scored only when the kicking robot is in the opponent’s half.Once a goal is scored or the ball has left the field, it will be placed again near one of the corners at the own side of the field.
Challenge 2 – Navigation
Two sets of obstacles (see attached sketch) are placed at each side of the field. One robot starts at the center of the field and must drive from one penalty mark of the field to the other as many times as possible within 120s. Every lap (from one set of obstacles to the other and back) counts as one point. Each time it has to drive through the gap between two obstacles. If it touches an obstacle, it gets a penalty of -1 points.
Additionally, teams are allowed to use up to three robots in parallel and sum up their laps. If two robots touch each other, the penalty also applies (per touching event, not per robot, of course).
If a robot has driven at least one lap (independently of the number of collisions), the team’s minimum number of points will be 1.
The red line indicates an example trajectory of a robot performing this challenge.
Challenges – Overall Ranking
The results from both challenges will be combined to get an overall technical challenge ranking.
To combine the challenge results, we will use the following formula:
Let BALL_SUM be the sum of all points that all teams received in the ball challenge and BALL_TEAM the number of points a single team received. Assume the same for the navigation challenge (NAV_*).
Then TOTAL_TEAM = BALL_TEAM / BALL_SUM + NAV_TEAM / NAV_SUM

CONTENT:
A key distinguishing characteristic of the Small Size League is its tight integration of software and hardware, which is crucial to success. A purely simulated tournament may reflect the best in software, but it excludes hardware development and omits hardware-software integration. To address this gap, the SSL hardware challenges will be conducted alongside the virtual SSL soccer tournament for RoboCup 2021. The rules for the SSL Hardware Challenges require significantly fewer resources than a full-size SSL field setup, and takes into account the constraints identified by the SSL teams.
The rules of the hardware challenges are available in both HTML format optimized for viewing on electronic devices and as a PDF for printing:

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions by February 1st, 2022:

Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).
Submit a Team Video.
Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2022 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

Team Name
Country
University
Main contact name and email
Website (if you have one)
Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be made via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The TDP should contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP should focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations should be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP should have a clear structure and it should be written in clear English.
The TDP should be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions.
The TDP should be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP should describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
We have to set up a conference management system to handle this year’s peer review process. It can be accessed at https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2022.
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existing account, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To create an account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. To submit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.
TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020 – This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardware improvements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also the reasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for other teams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier for reviewers to read it. It also has no overlaps with the team’s previous paper.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper – This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planning system. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significant changes in that area, and mentioning them would only mean having overlap with the previous paper. The size of the paper is also not excessively long.  
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020 – This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, the mechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It is a bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers each topic well and does not have overlap with the previous paper. 

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time. As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could be significantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. The qualification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old. Due to the COVID pandemic we allow to use a video from 2019, especially from participating in RoboCup Sydney, too. If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams to prove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If your video is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match, teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (see listing below).  The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. For participating in Division A, teams also have to show their ball placement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2022 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in a modern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

Dear SSL community,
as in past years, we are happy to submit our entry for the Open SourceAward.
You will find a list of our publications below.
Framework + Simulator:
This is the main software we use to develop and test our AI. It is able to– receive and process real life vision data– simulate SSL games– control robots– create game recordings and play them back…and much more.
New features since last years RoboCup include:– A new dribbling filter– Basic Git integration (i.e. show the Commit the binary is built from)Git integration into our log format will be released soon afterRoboCup– Various bug fixes and small features
The repository also contains our simulator, bundled as a standaloneexecutable for usage in this years RoboCup.
https://github.com/robotics-erlangen/framework
Autoref
This is our automatic referee, that detects the various ruleinfringements teams can commit during a SSL game.
https://github.com/robotics-erlangen/autoref
In case you have questions about our software or are just curious, feelwelcome to write an email to info@robotics-erlangen.de
Best regardsPaul BergmannER-Force
RoboTeam Twente
Dear SSL-Community,
For the first year since competing RoboTeam Twente is ready to enter for the Open Source Award. As all of our team members change (almost) in full every year we strive to have detailed and easy to understand documentation for everyone. This means that apart from all our designs we have collected all our recent how-to’s, design decisions and detailed explanations into a wiki. This wiki we also use to introduce new people to our team, so we hope it can be especially helpful for newer teams and those who are looking into tips for building enough robots to transition to division A.
Our wiki can be found here: https://wiki.roboteamtwente.nl/
Although the wiki also describes all previously made design in terms of hardware and software, some highlights of the changes we made this year include:
– Transitioning to a modular design with hardware and electronics combined for faster repair and more extensive testing. (rationale)- A fully renewed Front Assembly, which contains our dribbler and a new dampening mechanism. (design | rationale)– Custom made space-saving solenoids for kicking and chipping which freed up quite some space in our robots. (design | rationale)– Newly designed path planning based on bang-bang trajectories. (rationale)
We hope this can help other teams in their process of improving the SSL robots. If you have any questions we are more than happy to answer them, and if you find it useful we would love to hear that from you. We look forward to seeing you all at the RoboCup!
Kind regards,
Anne van Harten | RoboTeam Twente

Dear SSL community,
Since the end of 2020, we have been releasing a good number of repositories as open source software. We are doing it for two main reasons.
Firstly, we believe on the give-a-penny-take-a-penny concept. Based on this principle, since we are daily using lots of open source software developed by the Small Size League Community, we should also share our software in a sign of gratitude, in a way of contributing to the community that have always supported us.
Secondly, we believe that sharing software is important for educational purposes, we have learned a lot from open source software (like how to rewrite and reuse a piece of software) and we hope that, releasing our software to the public, we can help others in that way too. Sharing software is equivalent to sharing knowledge, which is beneficial for everyone.
Below you will find our repositories.
Software (SSL-Strategy)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy>
Languages: C++ (almost 99% of the source code); Python; QMake
This is the software that we use during RoboCup matches. Its main purpose is to control one team during a Small Size League game. The GUI is highly customizable (with options like selecting number of defenders and offenders, the maximum speed of the robots, the maximum strength of a kick and so on). It has a nice graphical client for visualizing the field and some options, like the interaction with the simulator.
To improve the quality and usefulness of our open-source material we’ve started slowly changing our code base from portuguese to english. Although it demands a great effort to translate all the previous code, we believe that this should greatly improve the accessibility of our code base to the league.
Software (LogAnalyserRoboFEI-SSL)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/LogAnalyserRoboFei-SSL>
Languages: C++; QMake
This software is based on the Robocup Small Size League C++ Log Tools (https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-logtools) and on the RoboFEI Small Size League Main Software (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy).
It provides a simple log player combined with a graphical client can that read vision and referee messages (from the network or directly from the log player). Furthermore it provides more options for loading and playing a match log file; for example, it is possible to ignore the match states when the game is stopped or halted and consider the other states. The Kalman filter from our main software is also embedded with the application.
At last, the Enable Analysis option activates a feature that can check when a shoot move or pass move occurs and it in a 0 to 250 scale. At the end of the game, the software generates the information of all moves occurred on the match.
We are working on an implementation that provides a game statistics viewer tool that shows statistics of the game (like the ball possession, the amount of passes and pass precision, shoots to goal and so on), but it is still in development.
Software (JoystickRobotController):
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/joystickrobotcontroller>
Languages:C++; QMake
The objective of this software is to easily test the RoboFEI robots – verifying if the robots wheels, kick sensor, dribbler, and other components are working properly. It makes it possible to control the robot, either with a joystick controller or with a computer keyboard.
Sincerely,
The RoboFEI team.
TIGERs Mannheim
Dear SSL-community,
as in the past years we are very happy to announce our entry for theOpen Source Award. By now there is a one-stop shop to get it all:https://github.com/TIGERs-MannheimWe are doing a complete and full release of everything we have,including electronics, mechanics, and our full AI. Here is a briefdescription of what has changed.
Mechanics:The kicker and dribbler have been slightly updated to be more robust.The dribbler now allows prolonged periods of dribbling with highertorque. The release includes the full robot mechanics.
Firmware:The build system has been changed to CMake and the folder structure hasbeen reorganized. The dribbler control algorithm now allows bettercurrent and speed control. Test and model identification methods havebeen cleaned up and improved. The release also includes our wirelessprotocol and base station firmware.
Software (AI):The heart and brain of our team, the central control software “Sumatra”.Of course, compatible with the simulation protocol. So you can test yourAI against ours locally. Watch out for some serious dribbling moveswhich will make you sweat 😉
In case you are missing any information or if you are just curios,contact us on Discord or write us an email.
Tigertastic Greetings,TIGERs Mannheim

DOCUMENT 176
SOURCE: https://ssl.robocup.org/divisions/
CONTENT:
Since 2018 the Small Size League is divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions.
Division Assignments
When submitting the qualification material, each team chooses a preferred division and includes a short rationale.
The Organizing Committee makes division assignments based on available spots at competition, previous performance, qualification materials, and team preference.
Motivation for Implementation
There are multiple benefits of having two divisions.
The SSL has a rather high entry barrier. Our goal is to further advance the league while keeping the entry barrier at a reasonable level. With splitting the league, we can challenge seasoned teams while still being attractive for newcomers. The qualification criteria for the division B can even be lowered a bit without hurting the competition.Feedback from RoboCup 2017 has shown that it is very important for teams to face off against opponents of similar skill. Dividing the league into two divisions rids a lot of the one sided games in exchange for more interesting match-ups.

Organizing the RoboCup requires a lot more than knowing the rules. The SSL committee maintains a requirements document with all the details that make up a full fledged tournament. It is used to make sure that the local organizers set up the venue to the leagues needs.

As this document can also be very valuable for teams to organize their own tournaments or to set up their own home fields, we will publish the requirements document of each RoboCup starting with 2022.

Requirements for RoboCup SSL 2022

Requirements for RoboCup SSL 2023

Requirements for RoboCup SSL 2024

Requirements for RoboCup SSL 2025
In addition to the normal requirements document we also had a network requirements document until 2024, since the team responsible to setup the networking infrastructure at the RoboCup and the venue organization / the contractor to build the field are usually different. Also the networking requirements have their own complexity for why it was separated from the main document. Since there were significant changes in the network requirements from 2025 on and the responsibility for the various network areas were changed, both documents were reunited again.

Technical Challenges of the Small Size League are intended to encourage teams to develop solutions to specific problems that will advance the quality of gameplay within the league. Teams are evaluated for their completion of the challenge during a designated time at RoboCup each year.
Rules
Below are the rules for the different RoboCup 2023 technical challenges. Source code associated with these challenges can be found on GitHub.
Chip Pass Challenge
This challenge will be similar to the Pass endurance Hardware Challenge from 2021. The goal is to perform as many passes as possible within a certain time. As an additional challenge, there will be more points if the ball is chipped.
Chip Pass Challenge Rules (HTML)Chip Pass Challenge Rules (PDF)

Ball Placement Challenge
There will be a ball placement challenge similar to previous years, but with an adapted scoring system. Only teams that never participated in division A before may attend it. We will not require attendance, though we strongly encourage teams to do so.

DOCUMENT 182
SOURCE: https://ssl.robocup.org/technical-overview-of-the-small-size-league/
CONTENT:
This page gives a technical overview of the league. It is meant to give people that are not yet familiar with how the SSL is structured a first high level overview and references to where to look for more information.
SSL ComponentsSSL-VisionSSL-Game-ControllerAutoRefsSimulatorsVision TrackersTeam AITeam RobotsAdditional League InfrastructureSSL-Log-ToolsSSL-Status-BoardSSL-Vision-ClientSSL-Simulation-SetupSSL-SetupSSL-Match-StatsStandard Network ParametersProtobuf Definitions
SSL Components
The following figure shows the different components and how they interact with each other:

SSL-Vision
This is the official, league-maintained software for robot and ball detection. It is responsible for transforming images from all cameras over the field to coordinates that are broadcast to the teams via multicast. During a competition, it is set up by the technical committee. Teams do not have to take care of it. However, the detections are not reliable and require further processing. Also, for division A there are two cameras. Detections can be on both cameras and need to be merged accordingly.
SSL-Vision on GitHub
SSL-Game-Controller
A match is coordinated by the SSL-Game-Controller. It is running on a computer next to each field and has a UI for the game controller operator. The game controller broadcasts referee messages via multicast, just like SSL-Vision. Additionally, there are synchronous network interfaces for autoRefs and teams to communicate bidirectionally.
SSL-Game-Controller on GitHub
AutoRefs
There are automatic referees that supervise a match and support the SSL-Game-Controller, mainly with detecting fouls. In order to increase robustness and fairness of the foul detections, multiple AutoRefs can (and will) run simultaneously and decisions can be based on a majority vote.
There are two implementations that are currently under active development by teams and that are used since RoboCup 2018: 

ER-Force
TIGERs Mannheim

For reference, the following implementations also exist, but are not currently in use:

ssl-autonomous-refbox (one of the first prototypes)
CM Dragons
RoboTeam Twente

Simulators
The Simulation Protocol defines a common way to communicate with an SSL simulator. It has been initially introduced for the virtual tournament at RoboCup 2021. The common protocol should encourage teams to publish their simulator or to use other open sourced simulators. By having a common protocol, switching between different implementations gets easier.
The protocol allows simulators to add some custom definitions, like additional realism configurations.
There are currently two open-sourced simulators available: 

grSim
ER-Force simulator

Vision Trackers
The data that is published by SSL-Vision is only raw positions per camera. They are noisy, can vanish sometimes and there is no velocity included.
Not only teams have to take care of that, but also the autoRefs. Since RoboCup 2023, the autoRefs officially publish their filtered/tracked data. Teams, especially new ones, are welcome to use this data instead or in addition to the SSL-Vision data. The SSL-Game-Controller also consumes these packages.
You can find the Vision Tracker Protocol on GitHub.
Team AI
Teams have to write their own software framework that is capable of receiving data from ssl-vision and ssl-game-controller and to communicate with their robots. The communication to the robots is not yet standardized. Most SSL teams use either low-level radio modules that work in the 2.4 GHz range or use 5 GHz Wifi.
Team Robots
Teams have to build their robots from scratch. They have to comply to the rules, mainly fit into a 180x150mm cylinder. A lot about how to design a robot can be found in the Open Source Contributions and the TDPs.
Additional League Infrastructure
League-maintained software is stored and managed in the RoboCup Small Size League Github organization. Although the repositories are maintained by the Technical Committee, contributions from all members of the community are highly encouraged.
There are a couple of interesting repositories:
SSL-Log-Tools
The ssl-go-tools contain several CLI tools to work with SSL Gamelogs, including:

ssl-auto-recorder: Automatically detect new matches and create individual logs per match
ssl-log-recorder: Record logs manually
ssl-log-player: Play a logfile back into the network
ssl-log-converter: Convert log files to a human-readable format – a JSON stream.

For  more tools, have a look at the repository.
SSL-Status-Board
The SSL-Status-Board can be run on a large screen to present the current state of the game to the audience and the human referee.
SSL-Vision-Client
A simple browser-based visualizer for the field.
SSL-Simulation-Setup
The Simulation-Setup has been created for the virtual tournament at RoboCup 2021 and can also be used for future virtual events or for testing a full setup with all league software.
SSL-Setup
The SSL Setup is used to set up all the required software for a real tournament. It contains scripts and Docker Compose configs to install everything on a fresh computer running Ubuntu.
SSL-Match-Stats
The SSL measures metrics and statistics over past RoboCups. The code for the Match Statistics is maintained on GitHub.

Protobuf Definitions
There are several different protobuf definitions, distributed over multiple repositories. This section gives an overview of the available definitions and links to the respective repositories for the latest version of the protocol.
In general, protocol updates will always be made in an compatible way on the transmission side, so that no software needs to be changed on updates. However, renaming and removing (with reserved flag) fields can be done, if there are good reasons for it.

SSL-Vision

SSL_DetectionFrame: Raw robot and ball detections per camera
SSL_GeometryData: Global field geometry, camera calibration per camera and ball model parameters
SSL_WrapperPacket: Message that wraps the DetectionFrame and GeometryData
TrackedFrame: Filtered robot and ball detections
TrackerWrapperPacket: Message that wraps the TrackedFrame with additional metadata (not produced by SSL-Vision, see SSL-Vision-Tracker-Protocol)

SSL-Game-Controller

Referee: The current game state with commands, game events, team state, etc.
Remote Control

AutoRef: Send detected game events to the GC
Team: Change the keeper id and request robot substitution
Remote Control: Control from external device, like RaspberryPi with Display

Continuous Integration: Single connection for integration of the GC into a teams software

SSL-Simulation-Protocol: A common protocol for different interchangeable simulator implementations
SSL-Vision-Client

Visualization: Send shapes (circles and lines) to the vision-client

CONTENT:
Two technical challenges will be held at RoboCup 2013.
These challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop technical contributions and to test ideas that can evolve the league towards the RoboCup goal of 2050. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint, and the Committes encourages all the participating teams to compete in the challenges.
Until May 31st, teams interested in participating in any of the challenges need to announce their interest to the Organizing Committee . This is necessary for the preparation of the schedules. Please state in which challenges your team is planning to participate.
Shooting Challenge
This challenge will test the team’s shooting accuracy and ability to score a goal against four slowly moving defenders and one goal keeper. The task is to score from seven fixed positions in the field of play as depicted in the image below. The aim of this challenge is to score as many goals as possible.
Each team is allowed to have a single robot on the field of play during the challenge.The exact ball positions might be subject of change.The balls are placed one by one by the referee.For each ball position a “direct freekick” command is issued by the referee box. After the shot has been completed a “stop” signal will be sent and the next ball is placed.During ball placement a “halt” signal might be sent due to vision interference. Robots need to adhere to the “halt” signal and stop moving.The standard rules for the execution of a direct freekick apply, e.g., no double touch and lack of progress. During stop mode the robot needs to keep distance.Four defenders will move slowly along the outside of the defense area. The goal keeper will move slowly between the goal posts.Own goals by the slowly moving defenders or goalie are not counted.It is not allowed to interfere with the defenders or goal keeper. If the attacker contacts any of the defenders or the goal keeper, the number of goals is reduced by one.
Each team will have a single turn. Each ball position will be used twice. Therefore, a maximum of 14 goals can be achieved.
Each team is allowed to cancel the turn and restart the challenge once. The turn may be cancelled only before the last shot has been taken.
Navigation Challenge
Three robots have to navigate through a dozen of static obstacles from the left side of the field to the right side of the field, while crossing the center point of the field. The obstacles are randomly distributed in the center of the field. The goal is to reach the target positions as fast as possible.
Obstacles are randomly scattered in a virtual circle around the center of the field of play. It will be ensured that at least one path with the width of at least two robot diameters will exist through the obstacles to the center of the field from each side of the field. Examples of possible routes are depicted in the image below as lines with arrows. It does not matter which particular robot fills each target position.Teams will not be allowed to test with the final obstacle configuration before the technical challenge.Each team needs to have three robots navigating through the field, placed in each corner (corner kick position) and the penalty point as shown in the image below. Blue points are starting positions and yellow points are targets.All robots have to reach the center of field (indicated in violet in the image below) before reaching their target, such that a successful pass is recorded. If a robot moves to the target position without reaching the center of the field, a successful pass is not counted until the robot moves to the center of the field first and then moves back to its target position.Each collision with an obstacle will result in a time penalty of 5 seconds.Each collision with another robot will result in a time penalty of 7 seconds.Pushing or substantially dislocating an obstacle will result in a time penalty of 10 seconds.To begin the challenge a “force start” signal will be sent from the referee box and the clock is started.The clock will be stopped once the last robot as reached its final target and stopped moving. It is understood that the target position and center point might not be reached exactly due to vision noise. An error of 5cm is considered to be sufficient for this challenge.
Each team has two tries, and the best time is recorded as the final result.

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions until the Team Qualification Material Submission Deadline, which is specified at the beginning of the page:

Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).
Submit a Team Video.
Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2023 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

Team Name
Country
University
Main contact name and email
Website (if you have one)
Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be made via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs must follow these guidelines:

The TDP must contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP must focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations must be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP must have a clear structure and it must be written in clear English.
The TDP must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions. Contrary to the requirements in the linked document the (E)TDP should also include page numbers.
The TDP must be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP must describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
Like last year we have set up a conference management system to handle the peer review process. It is accessible via this link: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2023
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existing account, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To create an account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. To submit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.
TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020 – This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardware improvements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also the reasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for other teams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier for reviewers to read it. It also has no overlaps with the team’s previous paper.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper – This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planning system. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significant changes in that area, and mentioning them would only mean having overlap with the previous paper. The size of the paper is also not excessively long.  
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020 – This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, the mechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It is a bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers each topic well and does not have overlap with the previous paper. 

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time. As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could be significantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. The qualification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old. Due to the COVID pandemic we allow to use a video from 2019, especially from participating in RoboCup Sydney, too. If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams to prove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If your video is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match, teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (see listing below).  The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. For participating in Division A, teams also have to show their ball placement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2023 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in a modern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

SOURCE: https://ssl.robocup.org/tournament-rules/
CONTENT:
All teams must adhere to these formalized guidelines to ensure a smooth and successful competition. While some protocols have been used in past competitions, this page consolidates and clarifies them to maintain organization throughout the event.
Radio Setup
Each team must only use the radio frequencies assigned during the competition.

The 2024 Radio Frequency form is sent by the OC or TC a few weeks before the RoboCup at Discord and Mailing list.
Based on the team’s responses, TC will assign a radio frequency to be used during the competition.

Poster Presentation
Each Division A team must bring a poster presentation with its development and innovations to the competition.
Division B teams are highly encouraged to bring posters and present.

Poster aims to maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs and TDPs.
The poster must be roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.

Practice
During the competition, at least one field will be assigned to practice. Each team will have a few half-field 30-minute slots per day.

The number of slots varies depending on the number of teams, field availability, and competition schedule.
If your team needs the whole field, you should book 2 field halves simultaneously. Note that you will consume two slots in 30 minutes.

Pre-Game
Each game has 4 teams involved: 2 teams playing, one assigned as Referee and Game Controller, and another as Assistant Referee and Vision Expert. Every team should arrive at the field 15 minutes before the schedule, as the kickoff should start at the scheduled time.

If the previous game is delayed, the 15 minutes should start when the previous game finishes. Therefore, referees and teams have at least 15 minutes to prepare for the game.
In the 15 minutes, GC, Referee, Assistant Referee, and Vision Expoert should verify the SSL-Vision, auto-referee, set up the Game Controller, and score sheet, get an official ball, and verify the two playing teams.

At the match schedule time, if one of the teams is not ready to play, they should use their timeout. If the timeout ends, the referee can ask TC/OC for their opinion before enforcing a forced forfeit.

CONTENT:
At RoboCup 2021 there will be a virtual tournament without any hardware involved. It will be played with the latest rule set, except that division A and division B teams will play in the same tournament. If one of the playing teams wishes to play with division B rules, the match will be played with division B rules.
The infrastructure for this tournament will be provided by the RoboCup organizers. Teams are expected to run their software on a Linux system, likely minimal Ubuntu 20.04 inside a custom Docker container.
The setup and configuration for the competition is available on Github, so every team can test it beforehand.
The tournament is hosted at https://virtual.ssl.robocup.org/
Procedure
The primary referee will control the game and should start preparing the next match at least 5 min before the scheduled start time. If the primary refereeing team does not show up 5 minutes before the scheduled start time, the secondary refereeing team will take over the role of the primary referee and the GC operator.
If a team does not show up within 10 minutes after the scheduled starting time or if one team forfeits, the other team will play on an empty goal in the group stage and will automatically win in the elimination stage.
Before each match
Initialize the game-controller
Start a new game.Enter the correct team names.Make sure that both autoRefs are connected.Make sure that all game events for both autoRefs are set to Accept.Make sure that all game events for GC are set to Majority.
Retrieve information from both teams
The Match Preparation from the rules apply, expect for the following differences:
Determine one main contact person per team (which takes the role of the robot handler and is the only one allowed to talk with the referee)Ask teams if both agree to play with DivA rules, else switch to DivB in GC.Determine team colors (like described in the rules)Determine which team will have the first kickoff (by flipping a (virtual) coin) and enter it into the GC.Ask teams for their initial keeper ids and set the id in the GC.
Start the game at the scheduled start time or soon after, when all teams are ready
Ask if teams are ready.Hit STOP in the GC.The match should automatically start with a kickoff as soon as all robots are at valid positions.
After the match
Make sure that the game is switched to the “end of game” stage at the top. This will stop the automatic recording.Submit the results to https://scheduling.virtual.ssl.robocup.org/results.

Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existingaccount, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To createan account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. Tosubmit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Qualification Process

After the Team Qualification Material Submission Deadline, the OC will reach out by email to all teams that submitted the three required materials for qualification (video, participation intent, (E)TDP). This starts the single-blind peer-review phase: Each team is assigned three (E)TDPs and is tasked to review them, answer basic questions about the submissions and share concerns and ideas for improvement with the team and/or the TC/OC.
To keep the review single-blind, please avoid self-identifying yourself or your team in the comments or shared media. The single-blind review is important to us because it allows reviewers to share their concerns or criticize the submission without fear for retaliation.Failure to meaningfully review the submissions may result in disqualification of your team!
After the TDP Peer Review Deadline but on or before the Preliminary Team Qualification Results Announcement, TC/OC will contact each team (again, by email) to announce to them one of the following four Preliminary Qualification Status:

Qualified: If the video and the (E)TDP are of sufficient quality, a team is directly qualified for the RoboCup. They are still encouraged to improve their (E)TDP by incorporating relevant feedback, but this isn’t required to participate. Teams can (in extreme cases) lose their qualified status – by prolonged failure to reply to OCs emails that are crucial for running the competition. Qualified teams can withdraw for any reason from the competition by announcing their withdrawal to the OC. Teams are encouraged to announce their withdrawal as soon as they know to allow for teams to move up from the waiting list (and to allow for a smooth organization).
On the waiting list: We have to limit the number of participants for the RoboCup. If the number of applicants is higher than our capacity, we give out slots based on initial qualification material quality (with a higher significance on (E)TDP quality), and a few slots are given out by chance. Teams who have otherwise qualified, but who haven’t managed to get a slot are on the waiting list. In their email announcing this to the team, TC/OC includes the current position on the waiting list (ranked by qualification material quality). If a qualified team withdraws, TC/OC will go through the waiting list in order and search for a replacement team. Keep an eye on your emails! If you are on the waiting list and want to withdraw, please also announce that to the OC to speed up the process.
Conditionally Qualified: If the video and/or the (E)TDP have major flaws, teams are usually conditionally qualified. In their email announcing this decision, TC/OC gives a list of conditions the team has to meet by the Final TDP Submission Deadline to be allowed to compete in the RoboCup. Failure to do so will result in disqualification.
Not qualified: In extremely rare cases (with a unanimous vote in TC/OC) a bad (E)TDP submission can result in the team being not qualified, without a second chance to improve their submission. This is only for extreme cases, and reflects that conditional qualification is a huge drain on scarce resources: While your initial (E)TDP was reviewed by three of your peers, checking your updated (E)TDP after a conditional qualification has to be done by TC/OC members. Initially submitting an (E)TDP that clearly isn’t even close to be acceptable for qualification and planning on writing a decent one only for the final (E)TDP Submission Deadline is disrespectful towards your peers who had to waste time on a review you are not interested in, and is requiring the TC/OC to do a full review of your submission themselves.

TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020– This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardwareimprovements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also thereasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for otherteams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier forreviewers to read it. It also has no (self-)plagiarism.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper– This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planningsystem. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significantchanges in that area, and mentioning them would only mean havingduplicate information. The paper is also notexcessively long.
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020– This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, themechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It isa bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers eachtopic well and it has no (self-)plagiarism.
 
Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time.As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could resultsignificantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. Thequalification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old.If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams toprove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If yourvideo is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match,teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (seelisting below). The qualification video can be either of the followingtypes, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game(i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). Thevideo should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. Forparticipating in Division A, teams also have to show their ballplacement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a teamto compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams inthe qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
 
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2025 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in amodern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

AutoRef Challenge

Goal of the Technical Challenge
This document is intended to describe the requirements of AutoRef software. The goal of this software is to help the human referee by automating decisions.

The Technical Challenge is conducted entirely before RoboCup 2016. 
Extended deadline for the AutoRef version that will be evaluated: March 14th 2016 (old deadline: Feb 28th 2016)

Setup and Requirements
The Autoref receives vision packets and sends its decisions to the traditional SSL Refbox which forwards
these referee commands to the actual game.
Both programs run on the same computer and communicate via network sockets.

The Refbox listens on Port 10007 for TCP connections communicating in the Refbox remote control format. 
The goal is to provide software that:

 detects as many infringements as possible (Alertness) minimize the number of false decisions (Accuracy) detects as many different infringements as possible (Completeness) subordinates to any decision a human makes on the Refbox is able to send commands for AutoPlacement has the ability to log a game in order to evaluate decisions is able to run on Ubuntu 14.04, with clear build instructions.
Evaluation
Subsequently,
 the submitted software will be tested. Every team is encouraged to 
conduct the tests and share their results. Ideally, a video of the tests
 is provided.

 A correctly detected rule infringement adds 1 point to the score of this Technical Challenge.  Every infringement will be tested multiple times according to the maximum number of points that is stated below. Wrong detection will subtract 2 points. Negative points in single infringements are possible.  The total points are the sum of all points. If the sum is negative,
 the result is treated as 0 points in this Technical Challenge.  The points will be normalized by the maximum number of points, which is 50. A team with 38 points will receive a 76% rating for this Technical challenge.
 Law 3: Number of Players (2) Law 12: Pushing / Substantial Contact (2) Law 12: Multiple Defender (2) Law 12: Attacker in Defense Area (2) Law 12: Icing / Kicking over midline and opponent goal line (2) Law 12: Ball Speed (2) Law 12: Robot Speed during Stop (2) Law 12: Maximum Dribbling Distance (2) Law 12: Touching the opponent goalkeeper (2) Law 12: Double Touch (2) Law 15: Throw-in (2) Law 16: Goal Kick (2) Law 17: Corner Kick (2) Law 13 – 17: Attacker not too close to the opponent’s penalty area when ball enters play (2) Law 13 – 17: Keeping the correct distance during opponent’s freekicks (2) Correct forwarding of commands to RefBox (10) Correct AutoPlacement commands (10)
Submission
So far, the following AutoRef software has been submitted: CMDragons ER-Force Tigers Mannheim 

Autonomous Ball Placement

Goal of the Technical Challenge
The
 intention of this feature is to minimize the time needed to restart the
 game. This is achieved by placing the ball autonomously by robots (“AutoPlacement“).

The Technical Challenge is conducted on Thursday, after the games. 

Procedure
AutoPlacement commands are issued by the AutoRef software. They are forwarded by the Refbox as game states BallPlacementYellow or BallPlacementBlue and include the requested ball position. Before and after those commands the game is in Stop state.
AutoPlacement may be requested before any referee decision, e.g. before kickoffs, direct or indirect freekicks, or penalties.

During ball placement the same rules apply as in Stop state. The only exception is that robots of one team are allowed to approach the ball, according to the team that is mentioned in the BallPlacement state.

The ball is considered placed successfully if the following conditions apply:

 no more than 15 seconds passed since the placement command there is no robot within 50cm distance to the ball the ball is stationary the ball is at a position within 10cm radius from the requested position
This means that the robot has to move away from the ball once the team considers the ball placed correctly.

In the case of failure, the AutoRef will command the other team 
to place the ball. The team that receives the ball after the placement 
remains the same. 
If both teams fail to place the ball, Stop will be sent and the ball is 
placed by the human referee.

If a team has not implemented ball placement or fails AutoPlacement the third time in a half game,
 AutoPlacement is disabled for this team in the AutoRef software. In 
this case, the other team will receive the AutoPlacement request. If 
AutoPlacement is disable for both teams, the human ref places the ball 
at all times.

If the ball left the field surroundings (e.g. after a chip kick) or is not visible, the ball is always placed by the human ref.

Evaluation
The TC reserves the right to change the evaluation procedure.

Every team places the ball in the same situations. The number and
 kind of situations will be determined by the TC. The command will be 
issued and the teams have to place the ball in 15 seconds and move away 
from the ball. 

A point will be awarded for every successfully placed ball. The  points will be normalized and merged with the 11 vs. 11 Technical  challenge. 

11v11 Mixed Team Challenge

The 11 on 11 Technical challenge is a full match between two teams of
 up to 11 robots, each composed of robots from two different SSL teams 
(here referred to as sub-teams). Each robot must be controlled by its 
originating sub-team’s software. Sub-team pairings will rotate so that 
each team plays with all possible partner teams.

Communication
Communication between the two sub-teams of a team is allowed, according to the following specifications:

 Messages are sent as UDP packets encoded with Google protobuf to port 10012. Sub-teams communicate only a rough plan for each of their robots using the TeamPlan message specified by the multi_team_communication.proto Google protobuf:
 package multi_team_comm;
 //Protocol to communicate rough plans to other teammates
 //Units are specified as follows:
 //length - millimeters
 //time - seconds
 //angle - radians
 
 //Plan of a list of robots
 message TeamPlan {
   repeated RobotPlan plans = 1;
 }
 
 //Plan of a single robot
 message RobotPlan {
   //ID of the robot from SSL vision
   required uint32 robot_id = 1;
   //Role that this robot is assuming
   // 0 - no specified role
   // 1 - goalie
   // 2 - defense
   // 3 - offense
   optional int32 role = 2;
   //Planned navigation target
   optional Pose nav_target = 3;
   //Planned shot target
   optional Location shot_target = 4;
 }
 
 // Location message, in mm. The center of the field is specified as (0, 0).
 // Positive x axis points to the opponent's goal
 message Location {
   required int32 x = 1;
   required int32 y = 2;
 }
 
 message Pose {
   //location of the robot
   optional Location loc = 1;
   //heading of the robot
   optional float heading = 2;
 };

Rules
Standard SSL rules apply to mixed team games with the following additions:

 A mixed team is formed from robots of two sub-teams. The maximum robot number is increased to 11 per mixed team. Each 
sub-team may have only a maximum of 5 players on the field at any time. 
Each sub-team may additionally provide a goalkeeper for one period. The 
goal keeper for the second period must not be provided by the same 
sub-team that provided the goalkeeper for the first period. Goals are only valid if robots from both of the two sub-teams 
forming a mixed team have touched the ball since the last stoppage of 
play. The robots must be able to submit to a speed limit imposed by the 
referee, subject to change during the game due to safety concerns. Teams
 will be allowed to touch their computers for up to a minute if the 
speed limit is changed; this time will be used exclusively to change the
 speed configuration as requested.
Field Setup
The size of the field will be approximately 13.4 meters by 9 meters, as shown below.

For the quad-size field setup, a total of eight cameras will be used, with two
separate computers running ssl-vision. 
The coordinate system, and camera layout will be as shown in the following
figure:

Computer 0 will run process images from cameras 0-3, and computer 1 will process images from cameras 4-7. On ssl-vision on computer 0, cameras 4-7 will be enumerated, but not running. On ssl-vision on computer 1, cameras 0-3 will be enumerated, but not running. Both computers will publish their data to the standard ssl-vision UDP multicast and port, 224.5.23.2:10006 
The quad-size-field branch of SSL-Vision has been pre-configured to the coordinate system and camera assignment for the quad-size field.

Field Configuration

The RoboCup 2018 will feature 3 fields.
Field A: 9x12m, used for official games of division AField B: 6x9m, used for official games of division BField C: 6x9m, used for testing (both divisions)
The time before the scheduled start of official games is reserved for the two opposing teams of the next match. If there is no time left between the end of a match and the scheduled start of the next match, testing time on the playing field cannot be granted.
On field C, testing time slots will be distributed by the OC. There will be three options:
One team can use the field as a half of a division A field (there will be a large goal as well)One team can use it as a full-size division B fieldTwo teams can use it simultaneously as a half of a division B field
After all games of the day have finished, all teams are free to test on either field. If there is too much demand, the OC will also coordinate it.

Tournament Format

Division A
Teams in division A will play a round robin group stage followed by a double elimination playoff stage.There are two groups, with 5 and 4 teamsThe team that places first or second the group starts in the upper bracketThe other teams start in the lower bracketNo team drops out after the group stage
Group Stage
Every group consists of three teams from pool 1 and one or two teams from pool 2The pools were decided using the results of previous official tournamentsThe rule that there is no more than 1 team from the same country in the same group will not be usedThe groups will be assigned using the SSL grouping tool and random.org

The following Open Source Submissions were made by the teams via email.
TIGERs Mannheim – AudioRef
Dear SSL-Community,
As in the past years we are very happy to announce our entry for the Open Source Award: The AudioRef!
https://github.com/TIGERs-Mannheim/AudioRef
The AudioRef aims to improve the understanding of the current game state for referees, participants and spectators in an intuitive and immediate way. To achieve this the AudioRef awaits state changes, card changes, command changes and new game events in game controller packets and uses configurable sound packs to trigger appropriate acoustic signals like whistle sounds or voice shouts. The currently available English and German sound packs have been designed with a specific focus on conciseness, using an intuitive whistle pattern and trying not to describe the obvious. You’re welcome to contribute your own sound packs!
The AudioRef has already been used at two local competitions and German Open 2024. You can hear it in action in this video from the German Open tournament (with the German sound pack): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgTJf4Soo_w
and very likely at the upcoming RoboCup!
In case you are missing any information or if you are just curious, contact us on Discord or write us an email.
Tigertastic Greetings,TIGERs Mannheim
ER-Force – Software Framework
Hello everyone,
ER-Force’s submission for this year’s Open Source Award is our framework (https://github.com/robotics-erlangen/framework). This is the main software we use to develop and test our AI.
It is able to

receive and process real life vision data
simulate SSL games in a full physics simulation
control robots
create game recordings and play them back
run strategies written in Lua and TypeScript
…and much more.

Best regards,
Christoph Schmidtmeier, ER-Force
Ri-one – Software Framework – RACOON-MW
Dear RoboCup SSL Teams,
Hello,
We are excited to submit our project “RACOON-MW” for this year’s Open Source Award.
Project Overview:SSL-RACOON-MW aggregates information from the Vision server and GameController and provides various useful information such as ball speed and robot speed together.For more details, please check out our GitHub repository:GitHub link: https://github.com/Rione/ssl-RACOON-MW
This software will be a perfect fit for new team: not only will it calculate your robot’s speed, slope, and intercept from Vision packets, but it will also identify your team and the opposing team using a game controller and a mode for simulators.These are then compiled and sent together in a single packet for your custom-made AI. This allows the team to focus on developing strategies!
We have included detailed usage instructions within the repository for your review. We hope this project will be beneficial to other teams as well.
If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.

Twente – TDP Search Engine V2
Dear RoboCuppers,
Once again, innovation and inspiration flows through the RoboCup. After last year’s successful Open Source competition with the Search Engine V1 , we’re ready to innovate once again! We would like to present the Search Engine V2! The project has received a complete overhaul. You can find it here https://tdpsearch.com/ . The new version supports the following additional features:

Ask ChatGPT directly through the Search Engine!
Papers from all leagues (over 600 and going up)
Improved search results with the help of AI (it’s magic)
Filter and search TDPs on leagues
Filter and search TDPs on year
It should not randomly break down anymore! (Thanks Azure)

Want to know how to onboard computer vision? BehRobot from the Humanoid Teen League already has figured this out. Is reinforcement learning useful? BadgerBots from the Soccer Standard Platform League can tell you. For robot-to-robot communication, ask Dagozilla from the Midsize League. And of course you can search through the latest papers from the SSL!
As a fun little extra, there is an image at the end of this mail containing a word cloud of the most used search terms up to now. If you want to know why Tigers is very much in there, here is a hint: “When in doubt, git clone Tigers” ~ Jorn, RoboTeam Twente
Best regards,
Emiel Steerneman – RoboTeam Twente

Immortals – AI software – Tyr
We are excited to submit our AI software, Tyr, for consideration in the open-source award category.
Tyr has been written from scratch for this year’s RoboCup, using parts of our old code with main focus on improving debug-ability and ease of development.
You can access the source code and documentation on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/Immortals-Robotics/Tyr
Best regards,

RobôCIn – Software Framework – ssl-core
Hi, everyone!
We are proud to announce ssl-core as our project submission for this year’s open-source competition. We hope it will contribute to the growth of our category at RoboCup.
ssl-core provides a framework for building distributed applications applied in the SSL environment that addresses the limitations of traditional monolithic software systems used in the category. The proposed approach is a microservice architecture that allows independent development and deployment in any technology, enhancing agility and reducing the risk of system-wide failures. 
To validate the system’s technologies, scope, and robustness, we developed the SSL VAR as an MVP of this repository aiming to use it in official competitions in the near future. SSL VAR provides real-time 3D visualization of the match (see figure below), as well as an analysis of past plays through replay at specific timestamps or events, such as fouls, penalties, or goals. 

To improve the separation of concerns within the system, the application’s GUI was detached from the core business logic handled by adopting a microfrontend architecture as a modern approach to building user interfaces. Thus, the microfrontend services can be separately deployed and accessed as a vision client, similar to the ssl-vision-client, but providing 3D visualization with the same functionalities as the complete proposed SSL VAR system.
Docker is the only dependency to run the SSL VAR.  To test in RoboCup, simply clone the repository and run:
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.robocup-2024-var.yaml up –build
For more information, visit our repository, we are always looking for enthusiastic contributors! Your contribution can make a big difference. Join our team and help us make the project even better! 
Best regards,
José Cruz, Matheus Teotonio, Uanderson Ricardo and Andresa Silva,
Software Infra Team, RobôCIn-INES.
luhbots soccer – Chipper with single coil for both chipping and kicking
Dear SSL Teams,
The luhbots soccer team is excited to submit our entry for the Open Source Award.
We present our innovative chipper, which utilizes a single coil for both chipping and kicking operations. This design offers several significant benefits:

Only one charge control circuit is required.
The simple design makes it easy for other teams to adopt.
It is an add-on to the original kicker, so no new design is needed. It can be adopted by teams currently limited to kicking.
Using a single, larger coil provides greater potential for design optimization.
Can be made entirely from 3D-printed parts.

You can find the repository with all design files here: https://github.com/luhsoccer/luhsoccer_chipper_2024Please feel free to reach out with any questions.
Best regards,Sebastian Knackstedtluhbots soccer

RoboCup 2020/2021

Due to the circumstances in January 2021, RoboCup 2021 will be a fully virtual / decentralized event. All teams, even already qualified teams via the Qualification for RoboCup 2020 are advised to read the following point carefully.
Evey team intending on participating in RoboCup 2021 has to sent a participation intent. The details can be found under Qualification Criteria.The RoboCup 2021 will be consistent of two parts: A simulation based tournament, and a collection of four robot-based decentralized activities. To participate in the robot-based tournament, you need to have access to a field of at least 4x3m. The detailed rules for the robot-based tournament are still being drafted.There will not be different divisions in 2021. The robot-based tournament does not play normal matches, so divisions are not relevant there. In the virtual tournament, both teams have to agree on the used rules for each match. If no agreement is reached, the rules default to Division B.Due to the unusual circumstances regarding the qualification for Robocup 2021, the organizing committee might ask some more experienced teams to review some of the newly submitted TDPs, even if the reviewer are already qualified for the event.

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions by 16th of February 2021: 
Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).Submit a Team Video (see instructions below).
In addition, every team that intents on participating in the Robocup 2021 has to sent an participation intent, even if they were already qualified for the previous competition. A participation intent is an email to the organizing committee. The email subject should be 2021 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include: 
Team NameCountryUniversityMain contact name and emailWebsite (if you have one)Tournament you wish to participate in (simulation, robot based or both)
Please pay attention to the following points:
All teams qualified for Robocup 2020 are automatically qualified and do not have to submit a Team Description Paper or a Team Video.Communication will be made via e-mail, using the Small Size mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every division B team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) and every division A team an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The TDP should contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.The TDP should focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations should be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.The TDP should have a clear structure and it should be written in clear English.The TDP should be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions.
In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:
The ETDP should describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.The ETDP should be at least 6 pages long.
Submission Information
We have set up a conference management system to handle this years peer review process. It can be accessed at https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2020.
To create an account, click on “Register”, next to the “New to CMT?” text. To submit a paper, click on the top left button “Create a new submission”.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review other teams, and every team will receive three reviews for their (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage and be under 2 minutes long. The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):
A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup game or one of the local regional competitions. The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill.A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.
The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Teams have been asking us if they could show a video of a simulation due to current COVID restrictions. We want to make clear that teams need to have real working robots to participate in the SSL for 2021. If teams cannot satisfy the requirements for the team video, they can use a simulation, but it has to be video of your robots participating in a (simulated) match (item 1 in the list). Additionally, teams should show to the best of their capabilities that they do have real working robots. 
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:
Subject: 2021 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.The URL of your video, which must be available via FTP or HTTP.
Please pay attention to the following:
Please submit a single video file.The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

Team Poster

Every team must bring a poster to the RoboCup competition that illustrates the content of the (E)TDP. The poster is meant to be hung up in the venue for everyone to see and read. Technical details how this is going to happen in 2021 will be added here as soon they are available.

CONTENT:
At RoboCup 2021 there will be a virtual tournament without any hardware involved. It will be played with the latest rule set, except that division A and division B teams will play in the same tournament. If one of the playing teams wishes to play with division B rules, the match will be played with division B rules.
The infrastructure for this tournament will be provided by the RoboCup organizers. Teams are expected to run their software on a Linux system, likely minimal Ubuntu 20.04 inside a custom Docker container.
The setup and configuration for the competition is available on Github, so every team can test it beforehand.
The tournament is hosted at https://virtual.ssl.robocup.org/
Procedure
The primary referee will control the game and should start preparing the next match at least 5 min before the scheduled start time. If the primary refereeing team does not show up 5 minutes before the scheduled start time, the secondary refereeing team will take over the role of the primary referee and the GC operator.
If a team does not show up within 10 minutes after the scheduled starting time or if one team forfeits, the other team will play on an empty goal in the group stage and will automatically win in the elimination stage.
Before each match
Initialize the game-controller
Start a new game.Enter the correct team names.Make sure that both autoRefs are connected.Make sure that all game events for both autoRefs are set to Accept.Make sure that all game events for GC are set to Majority.
Retrieve information from both teams
The Match Preparation from the rules apply, expect for the following differences:
Determine one main contact person per team (which takes the role of the robot handler and is the only one allowed to talk with the referee)Ask teams if both agree to play with DivA rules, else switch to DivB in GC.Determine team colors (like described in the rules)Determine which team will have the first kickoff (by flipping a (virtual) coin) and enter it into the GC.Ask teams for their initial keeper ids and set the id in the GC.
Start the game at the scheduled start time or soon after, when all teams are ready
Ask if teams are ready.Hit STOP in the GC.The match should automatically start with a kickoff as soon as all robots are at valid positions.
After the match
Make sure that the game is switched to the “end of game” stage at the top. This will stop the automatic recording.Submit the results to https://scheduling.virtual.ssl.robocup.org/results.

CONTENT:
A key distinguishing characteristic of the Small Size League is its tight integration of software and hardware, which is crucial to success. A purely simulated tournament may reflect the best in software, but it excludes hardware development and omits hardware-software integration. To address this gap, the SSL hardware challenges will be conducted alongside the virtual SSL soccer tournament for RoboCup 2021. The rules for the SSL Hardware Challenges require significantly fewer resources than a full-size SSL field setup, and takes into account the constraints identified by the SSL teams.
The rules of the hardware challenges are available in both HTML format optimized for viewing on electronic devices and as a PDF for printing:

Dear SSL community,
Since the end of 2020, we have been releasing a good number of repositories as open source software. We are doing it for two main reasons.
Firstly, we believe on the give-a-penny-take-a-pennyconcept. Based on this principle, since we are daily using lots of open source software developed by the Small Size League Community, we should also share our software in a sign of gratitude, in a way of contributing to the community have always supported us.
Secondly, we believe that sharing software is important for educational purposes, we have learned a lot from open source software (like how to rewrite and reuse a piece of software) and we hope that, releasing our software to the public, we can help others in that way too. Sharing software is equivalent to sharing knowledge, which is beneficial for everyone.
Below you will find our publications on the last year:
Software (SSL-Strategy)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy>
Languages:C++ (almost 99% of the source code); Python; QMake
This is the software that we use during RoboCup matches. Its main purpose is to control one team during a Small Size League game. The GUI is highly customizable (with options like selecting number of defenders and offenders, the maximum speed of the robots, the maximum strength of a kick and so on). It has a nice graphical client for visualizing the field and some options, like the interaction with the simulator.
The source code and the interface are all in Brazilian Portuguese idiom, so it might be difficult to use it for non-Portuguese speakers. Nevertheless, we are planning to add an English translation to the software; that way, the GUI could be used in both, English and Portuguese languages.
Software (LogAnalyserRoboFEI-SSL)
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/LogAnalyserRoboFei-SSL>
Languages:C++; QMake
This software is based on the Robocup Small Size League C++ Log Tools (https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-logtools) and on the RoboFEI Small Size League Main Software (https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/SSL-Strategy).
It provides a simple log player combined with a graphical client can that read vision and referee messages (from the network or directly from the log player). Furthermore it provides more options for loading and playing a match log file; for example, it is possible to ignore the match states when the game is stopped or halted and consider the other states. The Kalman filter from our main software is also embedded with the application.
Other additional functionalities like, download the Match League Log Files directly from the software and the use of predefined shortcuts provides an easy environment for the user watch Small Size League matches recorded or in real time.
At last, the Enable Analysis option activates a feature that can check when a shoot move or pass move occurs and evaluates this move in a 0 to 250 scale. At the end, a file is generated with the results. We are working on an implementation that provides a game statistics viewer tool that shows statistics of the game (like the ball possession, the amount of passes and pass precision, shoots to goal and so on), but it is still in development.
Software (JoystickRobotController):
Link: <https://gitlab.com/robofei/ssl/joystickrobotcontroller>
Languages:C++; QMake
The objective of this software is to easily test the RoboFEI robots – verifying if the robots wheels, kick sensor, dribbler, and other components are working properly. It makes it possible to control the robot, either with a joystick controller or with a computer keyboard.
Sincerely,
The RoboFEI team.

DOCUMENT 217
SOURCE: https://ssl.robocup.org/robocups/robocup-2014/robocup-2014-technical-challenges/
CONTENT:
Three technical challenges will be held at RoboCup 2014, out of which the Double-Size Field technical challenge is compulsory for teams to proceed beyond the round-robins.
These challenges are designed to encourage SSL teams to develop technical contributions and to test ideas that can evolve the league towards the RoboCup goal of 2050. In order to motivate more teams to participate in the challenges, there is no qualification constraint, and the Committees encourages all the participating teams to compete in the challenges.
Double-Size Field Challenge
For a team to qualify beyond the round robins, they must successfully participate in the double-sized field technical challenge. Successful participation is declared after scoring at least 2 points. Points will be awarded for the demonstrating the following skills on the double-sized field, where each skill is scored only once:
Taking a kickoff without a force-start (1 point).Scoring a goal against a stopped defense consisting of centrally placed goalie and 2 defenders (1 point).Taking an indirect free kick from the goal line without a force start (1 point).Scoring a goal on the stopped defense after a pass between two robots (2 points).Scoring a goal on a moving 3-robot defense after a pass between two robots (4 points).
In addition to these points, additional bonus points will be awarded to teams that play on the double-sized field for actual competition matches:
You get 4 bonus points if you played at least 1 game on the double sized field.For every goal scored in your best (highest scoring) double sized field game you get 3 bonus points. This includes goals from penalty kicks.
Procedure for the Double-Sized Technical Challenge:
The challenge starts with a kickoff.If the team successfully scores a point from the kickoff, the challenge continues according to the normal rules of the game, except all free kicks are awarded to the playing team.If the team is unsuccessful at scoring a point from the kickoff, they may request another kickoff in lieu of a free kick the next time the ball goes out of play.The challenge concludes at either the 5-minute time, or when the team withdraws after scoring at least 2 points.
Automatic Referee Challenge
This challenge will test the accuracy of a team’s autonomous referee software. Software entered in this challenge does not need to be capable of autonomously running an entire game; rather, the intent of this technical challenge is to demonstrate building blocks and provide a solid foundation on which others can build more advanced autonomous referee systems.
A team will be awarded the specified number of points after the software correctly identifies the specified event for the third time (no further points are awarded for additional detections, nor for two or fewer detections of a particular event):
The ball has exited the field, and which team most recently touched it: 1 pointThe RoboCup 2014 rule regarding multiple defenders in the defence area is violated, by which team, and to which extent (partial or full occupation): 1 pointRobots have collided violently, and which team was at fault: 2 pointsThe ball was kicked above 8 m/s, and by which team: 1 pointThe ball was kicked above 15 cm above the field surface and crossed the midfield line before bouncing or touching another robot (a new penalty at RoboCup 2014 defined in section 12.3), and which team last touched the ball before the violation: 2 pointsOne robot is pushing another without the robots first colliding violently, and which robot is pushing: 6 points
Any software that identifies one of the above events when it did not, in fact, occur will lose one point per false positive identification.
To participate in this challenge, all autonomous referees must be designed to receive SSL-Vision and referee box packets from the network to identify game state, and must be configured to avoid sending any packets onto the network.
To avoid any unfair benefit, all participants will simultaneously judge a single live RoboCup game. All autonomous referees will be attached to the field network. A neutral third party will monitor each autonomous referee computer’s display; teams are responsible for making their autonomous referee software easy enough to explain to this third party. Please consider the use of a scrolling log format (this could be as simple as writing messages to standard output), for ease of reading and re-examination of past output. The neutral third party will record each instance of an event identified by the autonomous referee, along with whether the positive identification was true or false.
For the purposes of this technical challenge, a positive identification is considered true if and only if the human referee on duty at the game makes the same call. As the purpose of this challenge is to detect specific events, not to run a complete game, the referee will be requested to announce all relevant events, including those (s)he would not normally call due to e.g. the precedence rules or anticipated benefit rules set out in section 5.2 if the Laws of the Game. The referee will also be requested to consider input from his/her assistant when announcing these events, as some events may happen outside the referee’s line of sight.
In order to be declared as successfully participating in this technical challenge, a team’s autonomous referee software must:

Qualification Criteria

Every team interested to participate must complete the following actions until the Team Qualification Material Submission Deadline, which is specified at the beginning of the page:

Submit a Team Description Paper (see instructions below).
Submit a Team Video.
Submit by e-mail to the organizing committee your intent to participate in RoboCup. The e-mail subject should be: 2024 Participation Intent <Your Team Name>. Please also include:

Team Name
Country
University
Main contact name and email
Website (if you have one)
Preferred Division (A or B) (More Information)
Short rationale for the preferred division

Please pay attention to the following points:

Communication will be made via e-mail, using the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list. Pay attention to these e-mails and answer the OC’s questions. A team that does not reply risks losing its qualified place.
We understand that new teams may struggle meeting all of the qualification criteria below. We encourage new teams to submit qualification video material demonstrating their true current capabilities, while stating in their Team Description Paper (TDP) what is expected to be completed by competition, teams not meeting minimum required criteria will be considered for inclusion only after all teams submitting compliant qualification materials.
The SSL will be divided into two divisions with separate tournaments: Division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions. The OC will have the final word. We are aiming at around 12 teams per division.
Since 2018, it is explicitly allowed to attend as a joint team. Such team will attend as one team and must submit all qualification materials once. It is allowed to use multiple systems, such as multiple computers.

Team Description Paper

As part of the qualification procedure, every team must submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) or an Extended Team Description Paper (ETDP). All teams intending to participate in Division A must submit an ETDP. Every TDP and ETDP will be reviewed by a panel of peers. Teams that present substandard TDPs and ETDPs will not qualify for the RoboCup tournament.
TDP and ETDP Guidelines
All TDPs and ETDPs must follow these guidelines:

The TDP must contain a brief description of the team, with citations to previous TDPs and the team’s website where appropriate.
The TDP must focus on innovations that the team has produced with respect to their previous TDPs. These innovations must be described in detail, to facilitate reproducibility for other teams, where possible.
The TDP must have a clear structure and it must be written in clear English.
The TDP must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, as the symposium submissions. Contrary to the requirements in the linked document the (E)TDP should also include page numbers.
The TDP must be at least 6 and at most 16 pages long.

In addition to the above requirements, ETDPs should follow these guidelines:

The ETDP must describe in detail the aspects of the team’s system which most contribute to its success.
To maximize the effectiveness of ETDPs, every division A team must bring along a poster that illustrates the content of the paper. The poster must have a size of roughly one square meter (A0) and will be hung up in the RoboCup venue.

Submission Information
Like last year we have set up a conference management system to handle the peer review process. It is accessible via this link: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/RCSSL2024
Each team will have to register, or log in with an already existing account, and upload their qualification materials to the site. To create an account, click on ‘Register’, next to the ‘New to CMT?’ text. To submit a paper, click on the top-left button ‘Create a new submission’.
Peer Review
Each team needs to review three other teams, thus resulting in three reviews per (E)TDP.
The Organizing Committee will assign reviewers to the papers.
The teams can upload their reviews to the site using their same login. Once the reviews are approved by the Organizing Committee, they can be released to the teams.
Teams that do not review the papers assigned will not qualify.
TDP Examples
The Organizing Committee has selected a few (E)TDPs as good examples.
TIGERs Mannheim Extended Team Description for RoboCup 2020 – This paper gives a very detailed explanation of the hardware improvements made to the team. It gives a clear explanation and also the reasoning for these changes, providing valuable information for other teams. The paper is also not excessively long, making it easier for reviewers to read it. It also has no overlaps with the team’s previous paper.
ER-Force 2020 Extended Team Description Paper – This paper goes in depth regarding the team’s new path planning system. The paper does not mention hardware as there were no significant changes in that area, and mentioning them would only mean having overlap with the previous paper. The size of the paper is also not excessively long.  
ZJUNlict Extended Team Description Paper for Robocup 2020 – This paper discusses the changes done in every area of the robot, the mechanical changes, the electronic changes and the software ones. It is a bit longer than what has been requested this year but it covers each topic well and does not have overlap with the previous paper. 

Team Video

Your team video must contain at least 1 minute of unedited continuous footage of game time. As game time is stopped during STOP or HALT, this could be significantly more than one minute of wall time of unedited footage. The qualification video has to be recent, i.e. not more than 2 years old. If the OC feels like your video is too old, the OC might ask teams to prove that their video demonstrates their current capabilities. If your video is longer than 5 minutes, for example a full recording of a match, teams have to provide timestamps of the respective sections (see listing below).  The qualification video can be either of the following types, although preference will be given to item 1 (then 2 and last 3):

A video of your robots participating in a RoboCup standard game (i.e. a game at RoboCup or one of the local regional competitions). The video should show obstacle avoidance, shooting and passing skill. For participating in Division A, teams also have to show their ball placement.
A video of your robots (there must be at least two moving robots) engaging in two or more of the following activities:

One or more robots competing against an active robot goalkeeper.
Two or more robot field players actively going to the ball and playing against one another.
At least two robots playing cooperatively against 5 static or moving obstacles.

A video showing one or more robots partially demonstrating capabilities listed in item 2.

The team video is used by the OC to determine the readiness of a team to compete effectively and is part of the criteria in ranking teams in the qualification process. Teams are advised to submit a video that best demonstrates the readiness of the team to compete in an international competition.
Submission Information
To submit the video footage, you must send an e-mail to the RoboCup Small Size League mailing list and CC it also to the organizing committee. The e-mail should contain the following information:

Subject: 2024 Qualification Video <Your Team Name>.
The URL of your video. Your Video must be either playable in a modern browser upon opening that webpage, or downloadable via HTTPS.

Please pay attention to the following:

Please submit a single video file.
The video must be stored on your own server or a reliable online video hosting service.
Do NOT send the video as an attachment to the mailing list nor to the organization committee!

Dear SSL-community,
as most of you should already know by now, we use to publish all our work each year during or after each RoboCup since we first participated in 2011.
And we continue with this attitude, because we belief in the importance of sharing knowledge to advance our league and the RoboCup.
Below, you will find a list of our publications and a list of the most significant changes. The documentation or description is included within the individual packages.
Mechanics
– Modified the curved front shape of the straight kicking plunger. This significantly reduced the spread of kicked balls when they are not perfectly at the center in front of the robot.
– Enlarged the infrared barrier PCBs on the sides of the dribbling device to prevent the silicon rubbers of the linear damping mechanism to fall out seldomly.
Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Mechanics-2018.zip
Electronics
– Usage of a new wireless module: Semtech SX1280
– Schematics and PCB layout of a tiny 34x18mm module with a single SX1280 module. Pin-compatible with most nRF24L01+ breakout boards on the market (SX1280.pdf).
– Schematics and PCB layout of a completely new base station using one SX1280 module and the SKY66112 front-end module for enhanced output power and antenna switching. Features network connectivity and a 5″ touchscreen with 800×480 pixels.
Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Electronics-2018.zip
Firmware
– Support for the SX1280 and SKY66112 modules (in base station and mainboard code).
– Enhanced wireless transfer protocol to make best use of the new modules.
– Adaption of the base station code to the new hardware (incl. completely new user interface).
– Base station touchscreen supports manual control of a single robot for demonstration purposes.
– Base station can be configured via touchscreen.
– New feature: Asynchronous Bang-Bang trajectories. They are intentionally not synchronized on the X and Y trajectory to reach a specific line/direction faster.
– Major update of robot controller and sensor fusion. The robot now uses a state space controller with acceleration output and model-based friction compensation when a position source (e.g. SSL Vision) is available. If not position source is available, local velocity output is used with a velocity-error correction for encoder readings. All models are derived from empirical data.
Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Firmware-2018.zip
Software (TIGERs AutoRef)
– Detect more rule violations
– Updated to new rules
– Significantly improved ball speed detection and chip kick detection (see Vision Filter)
Code: https://gitlab.tigers-mannheim.de/open-source/AutoReferee
Software (AI)
– Enhanced the integrated AutoRef for full automatic simulation of two teams playing against each other
– Offensive Action Trees for self learning offensive behaviors (see ETDP)
– Multiple new supportive behaviors for supporting the attacker
– Improved the selection of the best suited attacker that should handle the ball
– Improved the skills that handle the ball, like kicking, receiving, redirecting, approaching and catching
– Integrated new asynchronous bang bang trajectories into multiple skills
– More robust path planning with ahead-of-time emergency brakeRelease: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Software-2018.tar.gz
Software (Vision Filter)
– New chip kick model: We are now using fixed restitution coefficients for all hops in Z direction, for the first hop in XY direction, and for all further hops in XY direction (3 parameters in total).
– Online straight kick and chip kick estimation has been updated to use a direct simplex-based optimization method.
– Chip kick estimation can now optimize a complete trajectory, not only two hops.
– An additional optimizer can estimate all model parameters for a straight and chip kick with an evolutionary algorithm (CMAES). Model parameters can now be fully calculated within Sumatra, no further external software required.
– The Vision Filter is completey integrated into our official AutoRef software.
– Kick information from  our own robots is now used as a-priori knowledge for estimation.
– The viewport architect, which aligns the viewports of the different cameras and tries to minimize overlap, now supports different modes of how the viewports are calculated. Based on field size, camera positions, camera projections, or dynamically on detected robot positions.
– Correction of inbound SSL Vision timestamps. The average rate of each camera is estimated and the timestamps are corrected for each camera, mitigating network and processing delays. This increases filter accuracy for ball and robots.
Release: https://tigers-mannheim.de/download/release2018/Software-2018.tar.gz
Software (status-board)
– A new application for visualizing referee information during a game including new game events that are announced by the autoRefs.
– Additionally, a live view of the field.
Code: https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-status-board-client
Application is available here (and will so during the RoboCup): https://tigers-mannheim.de/status-board/
Looking forward to seeing you all in Montreal 🙂

Dear SSL Community,
We would like to share our 3D-printed SSL robot designs with you. We think that our design can evolve with help from other community members to become the standard robot design for the SSL teams in the future.Since most teams are getting into the struggle of manufacturing a high number of robots to meet the new rules of the league, we thought it would be good to share this design with other teams so they can save time on the mechanical part of their projects.
In this work, we have made a great focus on 3D-printing technologies. Nowadays, 3D-printers, unlike CNC machines, are widely accessible to individuals and organizations. 
All mechanical documents of our design have been published and will be updated frequently.
The latest releases can be found here:
